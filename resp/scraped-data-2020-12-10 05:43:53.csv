The new release is an official VS Code C++ extension for Windows 10 and Linux systems, as well as macOS, but not Apple's new M1 Silicon Macs. 

Supported devices for the C/C++ extension – one of the most popular extensions on the Visual Studio Marketplace –   now include the Raspberry Pi 4, Google Chrome OS-powered Chromebooks, the Windows 10 on Arm Surface Pro X, and other Arm-based devices. 

VS Code is a cross-platform code editor that has always supported Windows 10, Linux and macOS. Microsoft in July told ZDNet it intended to support Apple silicon hardware due to the large VS Code user-base on macOS, but it didn't have a timeline for when the extension and the VS Code editor   might fully support Macs that use Apple's new Arm-based M1 processor. 

In November, Microsoft's VS Code team assured its Mac users that Apple silicon support was coming by the end of November. The Apple silicon edition of VS Code is available but currently only in an experimental form for users on the VS Code Insiders preview channel.  

The C++ extension for VS Code brings support for Microsoft's AI-powered IntelliSense code-completion. The update is mostly targeted at the Surface Pro X, which now can use IntelliSense's quick info, autocomplete, and signature help features, as well as code navigation. 

The September 2020 1.0 release of the C++ extension enabled building and debugging on Linux Arm and Arm64 machines through remote-SSH, allowing users to pick their own compiler and debugger. 

The VS Code team is at Microsoft-owned GitHub's annual Universe developer conference. It's all being held online because of the pandemic, so everyone can access it. 

The next talk from Microsoft's VS Code team is at 20:15 CET and looks at how Microsoft is developing VS Code in the open on GitHub. Much like Microsoft's TypeScript superset of JavaScript, VS Code, built using TypeScript, is being developed in the open. 

""While developing in the open, our team has learned how to balance community engagement with delivering value and shipping code. In this talk, we'll share engineering best practices our team has adopted on GitHub to collaborate with our users, get feedback, and iterate quickly,"" Microsoft states.  "

Bloomberg's Apple watchers report that Apple chip engineers are busy making several successors to M1, the first iteration of Apple's Arm-based Silicon chips in the new MacBook Air, the 13-inch MacBook Pro and the Mac mini.

Early benchmarks show the M1 computers smash the Intel-based Mac siblings and even make Windows 10 on Arm look good compared with Microsoft's OS on its own Surface Pro X.  

Microsoft only licenses Windows 10 on Arm to manufacturers like HP and Lenovo as opposed to end users, so Windows can't run on Apple's new hardware. But an Amazon Web Services (AWS) virtualization engineer recently got a virtualized version of Microsoft's Arm variant of Windows 10 to run on Apple's M1 hardware.   

Machines in the current lineup of M1-based Apple computers are relatively low end, but Apple's next target with its Arm-based chips – an evolution from the A-series chips in the iPhone and iPad – are aimed at high-end Wintel PCs.  

Per Bloomberg, Apple's next M-series chips will significantly outpace the performance of the latest machines running Intel chips, according to sources familiar with the matter.     

The move could make Apple's Arm-based hardware more popular with developers, some of whom have preferred to work on Windows PCs or Intel-based computers that can run Linux.  

Linux kernel creator Linus Torvalds is keen on an M1 Mac, but refuses to buy one for development work because Apple hardware can't run Linux. He also thinks Arm servers for the cloud are out of reach right now because developers aren't using Arm-based computers at home, where they work.  

Arm-based processors historically have not had the level of performance offered by Intel processors, but Arm processors have delivered better power efficiency, making them ideal for mobile devices. Apple silicon potentially changes the equation.  

Bloomberg reports that Apple's roadmap suggests the company is fairly certain it can deliver improvements that remove its dependence on Intel, which dates back to Apple's 2006 switch from PowerPC – the chip design it collaborated on with IBM and Motorola in the 1990s. Apple is planning to move to its own silicon in 2022.  

Apple's shift to its own silicon throws a spanner in the works of the Wintel alliance, which also involves computer manufacturers like HP, Dell, Lenovo, and Asus. At the same time, Apple gets to extricate itself from the x86 Intel world.  

Apple is reportedly planning for 16 power cores and four efficiency cores for its next line-up of chips, which contrasts with the eight-core chips in its highest-end Macs today.  

According to Bloomberg, for Apple's higher-end desktop computers set for release in late 2021, the company is testing a chip design with as many as 32 high-performance cores –   more cores than the most expensive Mac Pro desktop, which can be configured with an Intel chip with 28 cores. "

And Apple's new M1 chip brings a product that fans have been asking for closer to reality.,Adrian Kingsley-Hughes,2020-12-09 11:46:00,Hardware 2.0,"Apple fans are a greedy bunch. Not content with the iPhone, iPad, and expensive headphones, these are products that don't exist -- fantasy unicorn products -- that they've been talking about for years.

Things like the Apple Car, or Apple VR goggles, or an iPad-like device that runs macOS.

Crazy ideas. 

Or maybe not.

Let's come back to that macOS tablet for a moment.

Must read: Best of the best gadgets of 2020

There's an interesting, rather glaring, divide when it comes to Apple's hardware ecosystem. On the one hand, you have Macs that are driven by keyboards, mice, and trackpads, and on the other hand, you have iDevices that have touchscreens and smart pencils.

It's an odd divide. And it begs the question why Apple doesn't have a touchscreen or pen-driven tablet that runs macOS.

Moving away from dreams to the cold, hard reality of technology, there are some good reasons. Tablets need to be thin and light, not emit hand-searing levels of heat, and have decent battery live and offer acceptable performance.

Building a device that achieves two or three of those is not hard, getting all four is hard.

Well, or it was.

The problem was that in order to make a Mac tablet, Apple was previously tied to Intel, and Intel chips always came with a performance/heat/battery life juggling act. The tablets out there that run Intel chips are on the whole an awkward compromise of the three.

But.

Apple now has M1.

Look at the performance and battery life of the fanless M1 MacBook Air and tell me that isn't a platform that wouldn't work as a tablet. 

The power is there.

The battery life is there.

The thermal management is there.

The whole package is thin and light.

It all makes sense.

When I've had this discussion before, the argument usually comes back to ""well, doesn't the iPad/iPad Pro do everything now?"" No, it doesn't. If it did, Apple would have slung the whole Mac line into the dumpster. 

People still need Macs. And a touch-based Mac would open up new markets, especially for the creative types, or enterprise folks who want the convenience of a tablet but the power of a laptop.

Will it happen? Who knows? But the pieces are now all there for Apple to build one.

Or maybe there's more money in expensive headphones that come with a weird carry case."

From Thursday, the NZ COVID Tracer app will see the addition of Bluetooth tracing, which adopts the Apple/Google Exposure Notification Framework. 

""Kiwis deserve a summer break more than ever this year but we cannot take our eye off the ball. The prospect of another outbreak should serve as a rock under our beach towels. That's no bad thing,"" Minister for COVID-19 Response Chris Hipkins said. 

When an app user tests positive for COVID-19, they can choose to alert other app users who may have been exposed to the virus. Other app users will then receive an alert if they have been near that app user who tested positive for COVID-19. 

The Ministry of Health will not know an individual has received an alert unless that individual chooses to get in touch for information and advice. 

""But it's vitally important that New Zealanders see Bluetooth as an additional tool that will help to speed up contact tracing,"" Hipkins said. ""We need to continue to scan QR codes wherever we go, and businesses, services, and public transport providers must keep displaying their QR code posters at all alert levels. 

""QR codes allow us to create a private record of the places we've been, while Bluetooth creates an anonymised record of the people we've been near."" 

Hipkins said combined, they complement the work done by public health units and the National Investigation and Tracing Centre to rapidly identify and isolate close contacts.  

""That continues to be the primary method for contact tracing in New Zealand,"" he added. 

There are currently around 2.4 million registered users of the NZ COVID Tracer app, of which approximately 90% will have phones that are compatible with Bluetooth tracing.  

Being mindful that many New Zealanders are without access to a compatible smartphone, Hipkins said that while no decisions have yet been made on any wider rollout of the proposed contact tracing cards, there is potential for the cards or other wearables to form part of a broader system of interoperable technologies. 

""The recent community trial of the cards with the Te Arawa COVID-19 Response Hub has highlighted that a partnership approach to any future rollout of cards or wearables will be essential to increasing community trust and participation with contact tracing technologies,"" he said. 

The app has been endorsed by the Privacy Commissioner, and the Ministry of Health will release the source code on Friday. 

NZ COVID Tracer will update automatically and Bluetooth tracing will be turned off by default. 

As of Tuesday, the total number of active cases in New Zealand was 54. The total number of confirmed cases since the pandemic hit the country is 1,729. 

Six new cases were found on Tuesday, all of them were returned travellers. "

After several months of rumors and speculation, Apple has announced the AirPods Max, the first over-the-ear headphones from the company not under the Beats by Dre brand. There's an overall retro feel to the AirPods Max, giving them a unique look. Up until this point, the rumor was the headset would be called AirPods Studio. Alas, Apple likes to stick with familiar marketing names, and the AirPods Max is the end result. 

AirPods Max are available to order right now at Apple.com and begin shipping on Dec. 15. They cost $549.

The headphones have all of the same features the AirPods Pro do, just in a different form factor. Each ear cup has one of Apple's H1 chips to help with connectivity, an adaptive EQ that adjusts the equalizer for each year in real time, for example. AirPods Max also have the ability to pause music when you take the headphones off, or even just move one cup off your hear.

The M1 chip computers have been getting rave reviews from developers who are impressed with the processor's performance. But is Apple silicon good for the data-science world?

SEE: Guide to Becoming a Digital Transformation Champion (TechRepublic Premium)

Python maintainers have released 3.9.1 Python, which is the first version to support macOS 11 Big Sur. As they note, Xcode 11 makes it possible to build Universal 2 binaries that work on Apple Silicon. 

The team has provided an installer it calls macos11.0 but points out that this variant should be considered ""experimental"". 

Python 3.9.1 is the first maintenance release of Python 3.9, which introduced a number of new features over version 3.8.

When Apple announced its non-Intel chip, it outlined plans to support both Intel and Apple silicon. Universal 2 will make updated apps automatically support both chipsets, while Rosetta 2 will allow apps that haven't been update to run in Apple silicon environments. 

Apple's switch to an Arm-based instruction set architecture has caused concern among users of Python since the company announced its plans.  

SEE: Meet the hackers who earn millions for saving the web, one bug at a time (cover story PDF) (TechRepublic)

""Apple announced yesterday that they will switch the CPU architecture for macOS over the next couple of years. While doing so, there will be once again binaries with multiple architectures (x86_64 and Arm64 this time),"" wrote Core Python developer Ronald Oussoren.

""I'm wondering how to deal with this in the naming of wheels. In the past we've introduced custom machine names for these fat binaries (for example, 'universal' for 'i386 and ppc'), but that was before the introduction of explicit support for multiple compatibility tags in the packaging ecosystem.""

According to Python Core developers including Oussoren, questions around using Python on Apple's high-performing M1 machines have been addressed, albeit with an experimental installer. 

""As of 3.9.1, Python now fully supports building and running on macOS 11.0 (Big Sur) and on Apple Silicon Macs (based on the Arm64 architecture),"" they wrote.  

SEE: The algorithms are watching us, but who is watching the algorithms?

A new universal build variant, Universal 2, natively supports both Arm64 and Intel 64 in one set of executables, the Core Python developers said.  

""Binaries can also now be built on current versions of macOS to be deployed on a range of older macOS versions (tested to 10.9) while making some newer OS functions and options conditionally available based on the operating system version in use at runtime."""
7,https://www.zdnet.com/article/whos-winning-the-race-to-replace-nand-flash/,Who's winning the race to replace NAND flash?,"Despite its success, NAND flash wins only because there's nothing better. That may soon change. For now the landscape remains DRAM for memory and flash-based SSDs for storage. But underneath the surface calm, the technology trends are churning.",Robin Harris,2020-12-07 21:55:00,Storage Bits,"The fine folks over at analyst firms Objective Analysis and Coughlin Associates sent me a copy of their 2020 report -- Emerging Memories Find Their Direction -- to review. It's as dense with technical detail and insight as you'd expect from a PhD, which co-author Tom Couglin happens to  be. 

It was only about 14 years ago that a bit of NAND flash memory became cheaper than a DRAM bit.  That milestone flicked a switch and soon flash-based enterprise products started remaking the storage market. 



                        Data storage: Everything you need to know about emerging technologies
                    


We'll see more change in the next decade than we've ever seen before in computer data storage. Here's what's coming.

Companies like Fusion-IO and SanDisk began offering flash-based cards with the performance of million-dollar disk arrays for 1% of the price. Meanwhile, cheap USB thumb drives wiped out what was left of the floppy-disk and CD-ROM markets. 

The new layer of persistent storage turned out to be a game changer despite the many limitations of NAND flash, such as limited life, block-only addressing,  and slow writes. New emerging memory technologies might have even greater impact on storage and system architectures than NAND flash. 

The report handicaps the contenders with rich and insightful detail on technologies, use cases, performance, density, and manufacturing issues.

The memories in the report include Phase Change Memory (PCM), Resistance RAM (ReRAM), Ferroelectric RAM (FRAM), Magnetic RAM (MRAM), Spin Transfer Torque MRAM (STT MRAM) and some newer technologies such as the carbon nanotube memory (NRAM) under development by Nantero. Most of these are in production today for specialized applications where features such as radiation resistance, high-density, long life and/or low-power, are valuable. 

Micron's and Intel's 3D XPoint PCM memory, with high endurance, much better than NAND performance, higher density -- but a little slower than DRAM -- might be the first of the new technologies to take memory market share from  DRAM. Intel's Optane NVMe SSDs using 3D XPoint were introduced in 2017, while they began to ship NVDIMM Optane products in 2019.  

Optane remains more expensive than NAND flash, which restricts its use in SSDs to cost-insensitive applications. Optane NVDIMM is only available for Intel's Second-Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors, which definitely slows market uptake. 

But what will replace NAND flash? The report concludes:

I expect to see much faster progress in the next decade, when one of these technologies, most likely ReRAM, reaches  a tipping point where its price/performance enables compelling new products. Enterprise NAND's need for costly and sophisticated controllers to overcome its limited lifespan and slow writes is its biggest vulnerability. 

Moreover, as the report points out, the ability of some of these low-power technologies to be fabricated directly on a CPU chip holds great promise for fast and efficient in-memory processing. The performance of Apple's M1 fabric-attached DRAM is only a first step.

The bottom line is that with all these technologies under active development, we're bound to see another storage/memory tipping point this decade, with many opportunities for substantial improvement in out digital infrastructure. I can hardly wait!

Comments welcome, as always."

The company says that a ""small percentage"" of iPhone 11 displays might not respond to touch due to an ""issue with the display module"".

Affected devices were manufactured between November 2019 and May 2020. Apple released the iPhone 11 in September 2019, so the issue affects iPhone 11 devices made after launch. 

Owners with affected iPhone 11 devices should take up Apple's repair offer soon as the program only covers affected iPhone 11 devices for two years after it was sold at retail.

SEE: 5G smartphones: A cheat sheet (free PDF) (TechRepublic)

Apple notes that iPhone 11 devices with an already cracked screen will need to get that fixed before becoming eligible for the free repair. Those repairs could cost money. 

""If your iPhone 11 has any damage which impairs the ability to complete the repair, such as a cracked screen, that issue will need to be resolved prior to the service. In some cases, there may be a cost associated with the additional repair,"" Apple notes. 

Owners can check whether their iPhone 11 is eligible for a free repair by typing the device's serial number on to Apple's support page. 

This is a worldwide Apple program but it doesn't extend the standard warranty coverage of the iPhone 11.

Apple is also offering refunds to owners who believe their iPhone 11 was affected by this issue and had already paid for it to be repaired. People with an affected iPhone 11 can get the repairs done at an Apple retail store or an authorized Apple service provider. "

Apple currently has 20 such programs running. 

Here are the details.

Has the display of your iPhone 11 stopped responding? Apple has identified that devices manufactured between November 2019 and May 2020 may have an issue related to the display module.

Do your AirPods Pro crackle when in use? Apple has identified this as a problem affecting some earbuds and has kicked off a replacement program for affected devices.

If the screen on your iPad Air (3rd generation) has gone blank (with perhaps a brief flicker or flash may appear before the screen goes blank) and was manufactured between March 2019 and October 2019, these are eligible for a free of charge fix.

Some Smart Battery Cases made for iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR may experience charging issues, such as not charging or charging intermittently when plugged into power, or won't charge the iPhone or only does so intermittently.

iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus not powering on? If it was manufactured between October 2018 to August 2019 then it might be eligible for a free fix.

If a crack has formed along the rounded edge of the screen of the aluminum models of an Apple Watch Series 2 or Series 3, this could be as a result of a defect that Apple is aware of.

Apple has identified that some MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) laptops sold between September 2015 and February 2017 may overheat and pose a fire safety risk.

Apple recommends users check their serial number against the database of affected devices, and if theirs is one of the affected units to stop using it and seek a free battery replacement.

This is a program that covers keyboard issues such as stuck, repeating, or malfunctioning keys on MacBook, MacBook Air, or MacBook Pro keyboards.

It covers the following devices:

 According to Apple, a small percentage of 13-inch MacBook Pro may experience display issues:

Affected devices were sold between October 2016 and February 2018.

Some three-prong UK/Singapore AC wall plugs shipped between 2003 to 2010 with Macs and some iOS devices, and also included in the Apple World Travel Adapter Kit, may break and become a shock hazard.

Some 128GB and 256GB solid-state drives (SSD) used in 13-inch MacBook Pro (non Touch Bar) laptops may be defective and result in data loss.

Some iPhone X displays may experience touch issues due to a component defect, resulting in either the display not responding to touch, or responding as though it was touched when it wasn't.

This relates to a logic board failure that can result in reboots, freezes, or bricked iPhones.

This relates to faulty batteries that can cause the battery to expand, and is limited to laptops sold between October 2016 and October 2017. Although this sounds dramatic, according to Apple it is not a safety issue.

A logic board failure can cause some iPhone 7 handsets to display ""No Service"" even if in cellular coverage. This affects iPhones sold between September 2016 and February 2018 in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Macao, and the U.S.

This is an odd one as it covers display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after the iPhone has been dropped multiple times on a hard surface. If your device fits the bill, and the device isn't broken or the screen cracked, Apple will carry out a repair for $149.

Some two-prong AC wall plugs designed for use in Continental Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Argentina and Brazil and sold between 2003 to 2015 with Macs, selected iOS devices, and Apple's World Travel Adapter Kit may break and be a shock hazard.

This relates to Beats Pill XL Speakers sold since January 2014. It appears the speaker may overheat and pose a fire safety risk. Apple is recalling these in exchange for Apple Store credit or electronic payment of $325 (or local equivalent).

This adapter, which was sold with the iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S models shipped between October 2009 to September 2012, has been shown to overheat and pose a safety risk.

This allows you to take counterfeit (or for that matter any third-party charger) iPhone, iPad, and iPod adapters to Apple and buy a genuine charger for the special price of $10.

This relates to the ultracompact Apple USB power adapter shipped with the iPhone 3GS in the US, Japan, Canada, Mexico, and several Latin American countries. It seems the metal prongs can break off in the wall socket, posing a serious shock risk."

Help is on the way,"iOS 14.2 still has a lot of bugs, but hopefully we'll see many getting fixed before the year is out.",Adrian Kingsley-Hughes,2020-12-04 12:07:00,Hardware 2.0,"iOS 14 -- or more specifically, iOS 14.2, or for those running an iPhone 12, iOS 14.2.1 -- is still pretty buggy. I wouldn't say that any one bug is a widespread showstopper, but more a care of a lot of bugs, each affecting a subset of user.  

Bugs range from that constant companion, poor battery life, to more random bugs such as poor cell reception and problems with notifications not showing up.  

But help appears to be on the way, in the form of iOS 14.3.  

Must read: How to securely erase hard drives (HDDs) and solid state drives (SSDs) 

As of late, I've been recruiting a few people suffering from iPhone issues into a small, personal test group to see if their problems improve (don't worry, I outline the possible pitfalls, but switching to a public beta of a minor release is less problematic than doing the same with a major release).  

Here's how you go about installing the public beta on your iPhone.  

And on the whole, the response for iOS 14.3, especially the latest public beta 3, has been good.  

Here's what I've been hearing back from users.  

-       Battery life is improved  

-       Performance is ""less laggy"" on older iPhones  

-       Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, along with cellular, seems more stable  

-       Bugs, such as notifications not showing, seems to be fixed.  

Seems good. I've been running the beta on my main daily driver and overall compared to iOS 14.2 it does feel more refined and better finished.  

As usual, your mileage can -- and probably will -- vary.   

But if you are suffering, then you can either take your chances with iOS 14.3 beta, or wait until the final version is released soon.  "
12,https://www.zdnet.com/article/too-many-browser-tabs-this-favorite-extension-is-the-perfect-solution/,Too many browser tabs? This impressive extension is my favorite solution,"If you regularly find yourself opening so many browser tabs that you can't keep track of them all, you're not alone. There are plenty of extensions that promise to conquer tab overload, but my favorite, Workona, offers a feature set that others can't match.",Ed Bott,2020-12-03 15:16:00,The Ed Bott Report,"How many browser tabs do you have open right now? If you're like most people who spend their workday in front of a PC or Mac, the answer is probably ""too many to count,"" and you're staring right now at a row of icons that offer only the faintest clue of what's on the tab associated with each one.  

Good luck remembering what's on each page when all you can see are favicons for each tab

When tab overload strikes, the usual cure is to declare tab bankruptcy and just start over, which means scrolling through your browser's history to pick up where you left off or to find that fact you need for the report that's due before the end of the day.  

Also: Best VPN service in 2020: Safe and fast doesn't come for free  

Plenty of browser extensions promise to help you manage too-many-tabs syndrome, but most just offer an alternative view of all your open tabs: lists or thumbnails, for example, instead of tiny favicons. My favorite, a remarkable web-based service called Workona, takes a different approach. It offers a simplified way to view and organize browser tabs and bookmarks, then syncs your work across multiple devices, with options to share workspaces with co-workers. I've been using it for more than 18 months and it's enhanced my productivity more than any other tool I use.  

My favorite solution for keeping browser tabs under control is a browser extension that allows me to organize tabs into groups called workspaces, sync those saved workspaces across devices, share them with team members, and connect cloud-based productivity services for instant access. Extensions are available for Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox on all major desktop platforms, with versions for Safari (on MacOS and iOS) coming soon.

Pricing: Workona is currently in preview and all features are free, After it's officially released in 2021, the free version will include all tab management features and allow up to 10 workspaces, with an unlimited number of apps. The Pro version will cost $6 per month and support unlimited workspaces with priority support and additional premium features

Workona is developed by a small team (11 employees) based in San Mateo, Ca. I've been using the software for more than a year and a half and have been impressed by the steady improvements and reliable support. The company is well funded and has a solid roster of corporate clients.  

After you add a cloud app from this list, its icon appears in the sidebar on the left.

The combination of a cross-platform browser extension and cloud service is uncanny in its ability to remember every open tab. I've organized my bookmarks and projects into workspaces, which sync across multiple PCs and Macs. If I shut down the browser, my open tabs are restored when I restart, allowing me to pick up where I left off.  

It's easy to keep projects organized by dragging pages between workspaces, and you can pin frequently-used pages to a workspace and organize them into blocks so that they're easily accessible even after you close the tab. (Pages you pin to the browser window are available from any workspace.)  

The coolest feature is the ability to integrate cloud-based apps into a workspace, allowing you to create a new document, start a Zoom call, or work with an existing project in Github by clicking an icon in the sidebar on the left.  

One bonus from Workona's tab management features is improved performance, as the software suspends tabs in the background so they don't hog memory. You can configure the maximum number of tabs to allow in memory (by default, this number is set to 25) and automatically restore tabs in a suspended state so that they're ready to go when needed. If you already use the popular extension The Great Suspender, Workona will integrate with it.  

Also: The best password managers for business 

What really sets Workona apart from plain-vanilla tab management software is its support for collaboration features. You can share a workspace with other members of your organization or use an email link, and you can specify whether your co-workers are able to edit your workspace layout or not. One nice usability tweak for newcomers is a feature that offers to create starter workspaces based on your business type: law firms, for example, get document management templates that can be customized and duplicated for each client.

The glue that ties all these features together is an Omnibox-style search box that allows you to find any open tab, workspace, or saved resource. It also includes command-line options to create new resources on the fly. Even with a 10-workspace limitation, the free version of Workona can make a major dent in your tab-overload problem.   

TooManyTabs:  If all you want is tab management in Firefox or Chrome and you'd rather not pay for the privilege, this popular, time-tested extension is your best choice.  

Partizion:  ZDNet's Adrian Kingsley-Hughes raved about this Chrome-only extension recently. It offers a subset of Workona's organizational features at a cost of $4 per month.   "
13,https://www.zdnet.com/article/jason-squareds-top-5-tech-of-2020/,Top tech 2020: The two Jasons pick their favorite gear of the year,These are the tech products and innovations that most impressed Jason and Jason this year.,Jason Perlow,2020-12-03 12:20:00,Tech Broiler,"Our last show discussed the various companies and products that earned a Tech Turkey award, and there were some doozies. Now it's time to talk about what are, in our opinion, the top tech products or innovations in 2020. 

Here are five products that stood out to Jason Cipriani and me this year. 

Jason Cipriani: This is kind of like 5G, where not everyone or every device is going to be able to take advantage of it. I only started using Wi-Fi 6 in the last few weeks with the most recent Velop Mesh system. It's blown me away. For example, on the iPhone 12, it's not unheard of for me to get 700+ Mbps in speed tests. The problem right now is that most tech we have in our homes doesn't use Wi-Fi 6, so the incentive to go out and upgrade today isn't there. However, the availability of both Wi-Fi 6 devices and Wi-F i6 routers has significantly expanded this year and will have a big impact on the home office, remote learning, etc., over the next year. 

Jason Perlow: The speed of Wi-Fi 6, which is also referred to as 802.11ax, is not the only significant advancement of the new high-speed wireless networking standard. It's also security, in the form of WPA3, which is a requirement of all Wi-Fi 6 equipment when they are certified. WPA3 is a major improvement over WPA2 in current routers because it uses a new authentication mechanism, known as SAE or Simultaneous Authentication of Equals to replace the PSK or Pre-Shared-Key in WPA2, which is a much more secure key exchange method. It makes it much more difficult for an attacker to record the session's encrypted transmission and then play it back offline to attempt to crack it. Some existing Wi-Fi5/802.11ac routers support WPA3 experimentally now, so if you can turn it on and you have products that support it, such as any iOS 13 or iOS 14, or any Android later than 10 or even Windows 10 2004, you can use that protocol.

Our pick for the best Wi-Fi 6 router this year is the Linksys Velop MX12600 mesh system. Amazon's Eero Pro 6, looks promising as well, pending further review.

Jason Cipriani: Perhaps a surprise entry, but I think the Fold 2 deserves a spot because Samsung took the original fold -- a device Samsung had to pull from stores a few days before launch -- reworked it, got it in good enough shape to release, and then kept iterating. At the time, I said it should have just canceled the phone, gone back to the drawing board, and tried again when the tech was ready. But Samsung proved me wrong, releasing the Z Fold 2 this year, with an improved experience overall. I think most of, if not all, reviews were very positive.

Foldable phones are indeed in our future, and Samsung is currently leading the way. 

Jason Perlow: So I am not a folding phone user yet because these things are just too darned expensive right now. However, I think Samsung is making some critical innovations in the space. It looks like Samsung managed to address most of the previous model's issues, including any performance and usability compromises it had. It is making progress, and for that, it should be recognized.

Jason Cipriani: Google finally got TV right. A Chromecast device with an easy to understand UI and a remote for $50… enough said. 

Jason Perlow: Look, to be honest, I was skeptical of Google being able to release a decent streaming set-top box, especially when you see how strong Roku, Amazon, and even Apple is in that space. Honestly, I wanted not to like it. But not only did I like it, I liked it even better than Amazon's comparable offering this year, which was slower, had less memory, just didn't have as slick an interface. So, now, I'm using it as my only streaming box in my living room. The only downside right now is the lack of Apple TV+ support, but I suspect that will be addressed at some point. The product is an excellent value for what it is if you are looking for a streaming device that supports just about all of the major services. And, as I discovered recently, you can even pair it with Bluetooth devices, such as headphones, so you don't wake up your family late at night when you're binging your favorite show.

Jason Cipriani: The way I review phones has changed a lot over the years, but that's because phones changed. There used to be a big focus on camera capabilities once phones started to get good enough to replace most point and shoot cameras. Then, the competition kind of leveled off, and it was almost a given that a camera on a flagship phone was going to impress. Each release is more impressive than the last, but only incrementally for those who look closely. With the 12 Pro Max, and to that extent, the 12 Pro, the camera is a giant leap forward. I took it out the other day to take photos for our Christmas cards, and I honestly don't think I'll ever take out my expensive camera again. It was much easier to hold up the phone, snap a couple of photos, and not have to think about adjusting ISO or shutter speed. Tap on the screen to change focus, hit the shutter button, and enjoy. 

Jason Perlow: So, look, Apple has been ahead of the game with its iPhone cameras since last year's 11 Pro Max; it completely blew away anything Samsung or Google had. The only vendor it was on par or possibly even behind was Huawei, and frankly, it isn't even in the picture right now. So, it's safe to say, if you are someone where photography is paramount for you in a mobile device, the iPhone 12 Pro Max is your only logical choice. What the company is doing with its microprocessors and machine learning is astounding for computational photography. Which brings us to...

Jason Cipriani: Apple had a tremendous year. Seriously, we saw more innovation out of Apple this year than we have in the last couple of years -- possibly combined. The ability to pull off a processor switch, where the underlying architecture is entirely different, and making it almost seamless for developers still blows my mind. 

I think about the approach Microsoft is taking with the Surface Pro X, easing into the ARM switch in public, through a beta… and then I look at what Apple did, making the entire transition behind closed doors and releasing it on day one, ready to go. Man, it's impressive. Everyone else in the computer industry is so far behind right now. 

Jason Perlow: I don't know where to begin with how amazed I am by this thing. I hate to start playing Apple word bingo, but that chip is astounding and magical. Cupertino put a tremendous amount of resources into it. Apple was able to take a processor architecture that was once only reserved for low power, mobile devices, and smartphone-types of application workloads and transform it into the future of desktop computing. 

Everyone needs to notice this because we all thought it would take a long time before Arm chips were on parity with Intel. We have seen with this hybrid SoC architecture from Apple a much more optimized chip for modern workloads. It is much more efficient with memory and power use and can run apps not only just as fast as Intel, but run them even faster depending on what they are and how the code is built. The open-source machine learning benchmarks on the chip using TensorFlow are off the scale, and even Arm Windows virtualized and emulated runs faster than what Microsoft's Surface Pro X can do with the Qualcomm SQ2 chip. 

Hopefully, the success of the M1 encourages processor designers such as Nvidia, which now owns Arm, to create other Arm-based desktop-grade processors that are licensable. And, potentially, there are also RISC designs such as OpenPower and RISC-V that are open source that pave the way for future non-Intel chips in the datacenter or even on the desktop, too.

This year, our choice for the best Mac for the money is, without doubt, the 2020 M1 Mac Mini."
14,https://www.zdnet.com/article/kotlin-language-maker-jetbrains-windows-10-and-m1-macos-get-android-jetpack-compose/,Kotlin language maker JetBrains: Windows 10 and M1 macOS get Android Jetpack Compose,"Developers can use a new user interface framework to bring Android apps to Windows 10, macOS and Linux.",Liam Tung,2020-12-02 15:00:00,Enterprise Software,"Czechia-based developer tools company JetBrains is making progress with its open-source UI framework, Jetpack Compose for Desktop.  

JetBrains is the designer behind Kotlin, the Google-endorsed programming language for Android app development that's compatible with Java. 

The company has been working on Jetpack Compose for Desktop, a UI framework for Kotlin apps that helps developers build slick user interfaces (UI) for apps. 

SEE: Managing and troubleshooting Android devices checklist (TechRepublic Premium)

It launched the open-source project off the back of Google's Jetpack Compose, a UI toolkit that builds on Android Jetpack, which itself is a set of software libraries for Android app development done in Kotlin. 

As Google describes it, Jetpack Compose combines application programming interfaces (APIs), Kotlin, and a reactive programming model.  

Google released the alpha version of Jetpack Compose in August but first took the wraps off Jetpack at its 2018 I/O conference and has been working on improvements ever since via new libraries. Jetpack is used by more than 80% of the top 1,000 Android apps.  

Jetpack Compose for Desktop aims to extend the promise of Jetpack beyond Android to macOS, Linux, and Windows. The software helps developers build UIs in Kotlin and run them on these desktop platforms. 

As with Kotlin, a key feature is interoperability with Java, in this case Oracle's Swing UI toolkit for Java.  

JetBrains' Android-to-desktop development program is still in its early stages, but it promises to help developers exploit Oracle's Swing to ""mix Compose elements with regular Swing elements and gradually migrate their existing applications to Compose for Desktop"". 

It also introduces early support for Apple's M1 chip that lets apps built with Compose for Desktop run on new Apple hardware with ""native speed"".  

Other additions include the support for Gradle versions 6.6 and 6.7, improved interoperability with JavaFX, and simplified reuse of icon assets between platforms. 

""We at JetBrains felt that design decisions made in Android Jetpack Compose by Google including the UI-as-code approach would make it a successful UI library even beyond Android space,"" says Nikolay Igotti, JetBrains development team lead.  

""And we build a lot of desktop products ourselves, many of them in Kotlin and on the JVM platform, so having a modern UI library for the Kotlin/JVM platform is important for us."" 

SEE: Keeping data flowing could soon cost billions, business warned

The company wanted to have a UI library for both Kotlin and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) platform to support its ambitions to be an important language for desktop development as well as mobile. Jetpack Compose was inspired by Google's Flutter UI app development framework and React.  

JetBrains has bundled Jetpack Compose for Desktop to version 2020.3 of its IntelliJ IDEA, the latest version of its popular integrated development environment.  "
