The new release is an official VS Code C++ extension for Windows 10 and Linux systems, as well as macOS, but not Apple's new M1 Silicon Macs. 

Supported devices for the C/C++ extension – one of the most popular extensions on the Visual Studio Marketplace –   now include the Raspberry Pi 4, Google Chrome OS-powered Chromebooks, the Windows 10 on Arm Surface Pro X, and other Arm-based devices. 

VS Code is a cross-platform code editor that has always supported Windows 10, Linux and macOS. Microsoft in July told ZDNet it intended to support Apple silicon hardware due to the large VS Code user-base on macOS, but it didn't have a timeline for when the extension and the VS Code editor   might fully support Macs that use Apple's new Arm-based M1 processor. 

In November, Microsoft's VS Code team assured its Mac users that Apple silicon support was coming by the end of November. The Apple silicon edition of VS Code is available but currently only in an experimental form for users on the VS Code Insiders preview channel.  

The C++ extension for VS Code brings support for Microsoft's AI-powered IntelliSense code-completion. The update is mostly targeted at the Surface Pro X, which now can use IntelliSense's quick info, autocomplete, and signature help features, as well as code navigation. 

The September 2020 1.0 release of the C++ extension enabled building and debugging on Linux Arm and Arm64 machines through remote-SSH, allowing users to pick their own compiler and debugger. 

The VS Code team is at Microsoft-owned GitHub's annual Universe developer conference. It's all being held online because of the pandemic, so everyone can access it. 

The next talk from Microsoft's VS Code team is at 20:15 CET and looks at how Microsoft is developing VS Code in the open on GitHub. Much like Microsoft's TypeScript superset of JavaScript, VS Code, built using TypeScript, is being developed in the open. 

""While developing in the open, our team has learned how to balance community engagement with delivering value and shipping code. In this talk, we'll share engineering best practices our team has adopted on GitHub to collaborate with our users, get feedback, and iterate quickly,"" Microsoft states.  "

Bloomberg's Apple watchers report that Apple chip engineers are busy making several successors to M1, the first iteration of Apple's Arm-based Silicon chips in the new MacBook Air, the 13-inch MacBook Pro and the Mac mini.

Early benchmarks show the M1 computers smash the Intel-based Mac siblings and even make Windows 10 on Arm look good compared with Microsoft's OS on its own Surface Pro X.  

Microsoft only licenses Windows 10 on Arm to manufacturers like HP and Lenovo as opposed to end users, so Windows can't run on Apple's new hardware. But an Amazon Web Services (AWS) virtualization engineer recently got a virtualized version of Microsoft's Arm variant of Windows 10 to run on Apple's M1 hardware.   

Machines in the current lineup of M1-based Apple computers are relatively low end, but Apple's next target with its Arm-based chips – an evolution from the A-series chips in the iPhone and iPad – are aimed at high-end Wintel PCs.  

Per Bloomberg, Apple's next M-series chips will significantly outpace the performance of the latest machines running Intel chips, according to sources familiar with the matter.     

The move could make Apple's Arm-based hardware more popular with developers, some of whom have preferred to work on Windows PCs or Intel-based computers that can run Linux.  

Linux kernel creator Linus Torvalds is keen on an M1 Mac, but refuses to buy one for development work because Apple hardware can't run Linux. He also thinks Arm servers for the cloud are out of reach right now because developers aren't using Arm-based computers at home, where they work.  

Arm-based processors historically have not had the level of performance offered by Intel processors, but Arm processors have delivered better power efficiency, making them ideal for mobile devices. Apple silicon potentially changes the equation.  

Bloomberg reports that Apple's roadmap suggests the company is fairly certain it can deliver improvements that remove its dependence on Intel, which dates back to Apple's 2006 switch from PowerPC – the chip design it collaborated on with IBM and Motorola in the 1990s. Apple is planning to move to its own silicon in 2022.  

Apple's shift to its own silicon throws a spanner in the works of the Wintel alliance, which also involves computer manufacturers like HP, Dell, Lenovo, and Asus. At the same time, Apple gets to extricate itself from the x86 Intel world.  

Apple is reportedly planning for 16 power cores and four efficiency cores for its next line-up of chips, which contrasts with the eight-core chips in its highest-end Macs today.  

According to Bloomberg, for Apple's higher-end desktop computers set for release in late 2021, the company is testing a chip design with as many as 32 high-performance cores –   more cores than the most expensive Mac Pro desktop, which can be configured with an Intel chip with 28 cores. "

And Apple's new M1 chip brings a product that fans have been asking for closer to reality.,Adrian Kingsley-Hughes,2020-12-09 11:46:00,Hardware 2.0,"Apple fans are a greedy bunch. Not content with the iPhone, iPad, and expensive headphones, these are products that don't exist -- fantasy unicorn products -- that they've been talking about for years.

Things like the Apple Car, or Apple VR goggles, or an iPad-like device that runs macOS.

Crazy ideas. 

Or maybe not.

Let's come back to that macOS tablet for a moment.

Must read: Best of the best gadgets of 2020

There's an interesting, rather glaring, divide when it comes to Apple's hardware ecosystem. On the one hand, you have Macs that are driven by keyboards, mice, and trackpads, and on the other hand, you have iDevices that have touchscreens and smart pencils.

It's an odd divide. And it begs the question why Apple doesn't have a touchscreen or pen-driven tablet that runs macOS.

Moving away from dreams to the cold, hard reality of technology, there are some good reasons. Tablets need to be thin and light, not emit hand-searing levels of heat, and have decent battery live and offer acceptable performance.

Building a device that achieves two or three of those is not hard, getting all four is hard.

Well, or it was.

The problem was that in order to make a Mac tablet, Apple was previously tied to Intel, and Intel chips always came with a performance/heat/battery life juggling act. The tablets out there that run Intel chips are on the whole an awkward compromise of the three.

But.

Apple now has M1.

Look at the performance and battery life of the fanless M1 MacBook Air and tell me that isn't a platform that wouldn't work as a tablet. 

The power is there.

The battery life is there.

The thermal management is there.

The whole package is thin and light.

It all makes sense.

When I've had this discussion before, the argument usually comes back to ""well, doesn't the iPad/iPad Pro do everything now?"" No, it doesn't. If it did, Apple would have slung the whole Mac line into the dumpster. 

People still need Macs. And a touch-based Mac would open up new markets, especially for the creative types, or enterprise folks who want the convenience of a tablet but the power of a laptop.

Will it happen? Who knows? But the pieces are now all there for Apple to build one.

Or maybe there's more money in expensive headphones that come with a weird carry case."

From Thursday, the NZ COVID Tracer app will see the addition of Bluetooth tracing, which adopts the Apple/Google Exposure Notification Framework. 

""Kiwis deserve a summer break more than ever this year but we cannot take our eye off the ball. The prospect of another outbreak should serve as a rock under our beach towels. That's no bad thing,"" Minister for COVID-19 Response Chris Hipkins said. 

When an app user tests positive for COVID-19, they can choose to alert other app users who may have been exposed to the virus. Other app users will then receive an alert if they have been near that app user who tested positive for COVID-19. 

The Ministry of Health will not know an individual has received an alert unless that individual chooses to get in touch for information and advice. 

""But it's vitally important that New Zealanders see Bluetooth as an additional tool that will help to speed up contact tracing,"" Hipkins said. ""We need to continue to scan QR codes wherever we go, and businesses, services, and public transport providers must keep displaying their QR code posters at all alert levels. 

""QR codes allow us to create a private record of the places we've been, while Bluetooth creates an anonymised record of the people we've been near."" 

Hipkins said combined, they complement the work done by public health units and the National Investigation and Tracing Centre to rapidly identify and isolate close contacts.  

""That continues to be the primary method for contact tracing in New Zealand,"" he added. 

There are currently around 2.4 million registered users of the NZ COVID Tracer app, of which approximately 90% will have phones that are compatible with Bluetooth tracing.  

Being mindful that many New Zealanders are without access to a compatible smartphone, Hipkins said that while no decisions have yet been made on any wider rollout of the proposed contact tracing cards, there is potential for the cards or other wearables to form part of a broader system of interoperable technologies. 

""The recent community trial of the cards with the Te Arawa COVID-19 Response Hub has highlighted that a partnership approach to any future rollout of cards or wearables will be essential to increasing community trust and participation with contact tracing technologies,"" he said. 

The app has been endorsed by the Privacy Commissioner, and the Ministry of Health will release the source code on Friday. 

NZ COVID Tracer will update automatically and Bluetooth tracing will be turned off by default. 

As of Tuesday, the total number of active cases in New Zealand was 54. The total number of confirmed cases since the pandemic hit the country is 1,729. 

Six new cases were found on Tuesday, all of them were returned travellers. "

After several months of rumors and speculation, Apple has announced the AirPods Max, the first over-the-ear headphones from the company not under the Beats by Dre brand. There's an overall retro feel to the AirPods Max, giving them a unique look. Up until this point, the rumor was the headset would be called AirPods Studio. Alas, Apple likes to stick with familiar marketing names, and the AirPods Max is the end result. 

AirPods Max are available to order right now at Apple.com and begin shipping on Dec. 15. They cost $549.

The headphones have all of the same features the AirPods Pro do, just in a different form factor. Each ear cup has one of Apple's H1 chips to help with connectivity, an adaptive EQ that adjusts the equalizer for each year in real time, for example. AirPods Max also have the ability to pause music when you take the headphones off, or even just move one cup off your hear.

The M1 chip computers have been getting rave reviews from developers who are impressed with the processor's performance. But is Apple silicon good for the data-science world?

SEE: Guide to Becoming a Digital Transformation Champion (TechRepublic Premium)

Python maintainers have released 3.9.1 Python, which is the first version to support macOS 11 Big Sur. As they note, Xcode 11 makes it possible to build Universal 2 binaries that work on Apple Silicon. 

The team has provided an installer it calls macos11.0 but points out that this variant should be considered ""experimental"". 

Python 3.9.1 is the first maintenance release of Python 3.9, which introduced a number of new features over version 3.8.

When Apple announced its non-Intel chip, it outlined plans to support both Intel and Apple silicon. Universal 2 will make updated apps automatically support both chipsets, while Rosetta 2 will allow apps that haven't been update to run in Apple silicon environments. 

Apple's switch to an Arm-based instruction set architecture has caused concern among users of Python since the company announced its plans.  

SEE: Meet the hackers who earn millions for saving the web, one bug at a time (cover story PDF) (TechRepublic)

""Apple announced yesterday that they will switch the CPU architecture for macOS over the next couple of years. While doing so, there will be once again binaries with multiple architectures (x86_64 and Arm64 this time),"" wrote Core Python developer Ronald Oussoren.

""I'm wondering how to deal with this in the naming of wheels. In the past we've introduced custom machine names for these fat binaries (for example, 'universal' for 'i386 and ppc'), but that was before the introduction of explicit support for multiple compatibility tags in the packaging ecosystem.""

According to Python Core developers including Oussoren, questions around using Python on Apple's high-performing M1 machines have been addressed, albeit with an experimental installer. 

""As of 3.9.1, Python now fully supports building and running on macOS 11.0 (Big Sur) and on Apple Silicon Macs (based on the Arm64 architecture),"" they wrote.  

SEE: The algorithms are watching us, but who is watching the algorithms?

A new universal build variant, Universal 2, natively supports both Arm64 and Intel 64 in one set of executables, the Core Python developers said.  

""Binaries can also now be built on current versions of macOS to be deployed on a range of older macOS versions (tested to 10.9) while making some newer OS functions and options conditionally available based on the operating system version in use at runtime."""
7,https://www.zdnet.com/article/whos-winning-the-race-to-replace-nand-flash/,Who's winning the race to replace NAND flash?,"Despite its success, NAND flash wins only because there's nothing better. That may soon change. For now the landscape remains DRAM for memory and flash-based SSDs for storage. But underneath the surface calm, the technology trends are churning.",Robin Harris,2020-12-07 21:55:00,Storage Bits,"The fine folks over at analyst firms Objective Analysis and Coughlin Associates sent me a copy of their 2020 report -- Emerging Memories Find Their Direction -- to review. It's as dense with technical detail and insight as you'd expect from a PhD, which co-author Tom Couglin happens to  be. 

It was only about 14 years ago that a bit of NAND flash memory became cheaper than a DRAM bit.  That milestone flicked a switch and soon flash-based enterprise products started remaking the storage market. 



                        Data storage: Everything you need to know about emerging technologies
                    


We'll see more change in the next decade than we've ever seen before in computer data storage. Here's what's coming.

Companies like Fusion-IO and SanDisk began offering flash-based cards with the performance of million-dollar disk arrays for 1% of the price. Meanwhile, cheap USB thumb drives wiped out what was left of the floppy-disk and CD-ROM markets. 

The new layer of persistent storage turned out to be a game changer despite the many limitations of NAND flash, such as limited life, block-only addressing,  and slow writes. New emerging memory technologies might have even greater impact on storage and system architectures than NAND flash. 

The report handicaps the contenders with rich and insightful detail on technologies, use cases, performance, density, and manufacturing issues.

The memories in the report include Phase Change Memory (PCM), Resistance RAM (ReRAM), Ferroelectric RAM (FRAM), Magnetic RAM (MRAM), Spin Transfer Torque MRAM (STT MRAM) and some newer technologies such as the carbon nanotube memory (NRAM) under development by Nantero. Most of these are in production today for specialized applications where features such as radiation resistance, high-density, long life and/or low-power, are valuable. 

Micron's and Intel's 3D XPoint PCM memory, with high endurance, much better than NAND performance, higher density -- but a little slower than DRAM -- might be the first of the new technologies to take memory market share from  DRAM. Intel's Optane NVMe SSDs using 3D XPoint were introduced in 2017, while they began to ship NVDIMM Optane products in 2019.  

Optane remains more expensive than NAND flash, which restricts its use in SSDs to cost-insensitive applications. Optane NVDIMM is only available for Intel's Second-Generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors, which definitely slows market uptake. 

But what will replace NAND flash? The report concludes:

I expect to see much faster progress in the next decade, when one of these technologies, most likely ReRAM, reaches  a tipping point where its price/performance enables compelling new products. Enterprise NAND's need for costly and sophisticated controllers to overcome its limited lifespan and slow writes is its biggest vulnerability. 

Moreover, as the report points out, the ability of some of these low-power technologies to be fabricated directly on a CPU chip holds great promise for fast and efficient in-memory processing. The performance of Apple's M1 fabric-attached DRAM is only a first step.

The bottom line is that with all these technologies under active development, we're bound to see another storage/memory tipping point this decade, with many opportunities for substantial improvement in out digital infrastructure. I can hardly wait!

Comments welcome, as always."

The company says that a ""small percentage"" of iPhone 11 displays might not respond to touch due to an ""issue with the display module"".

Affected devices were manufactured between November 2019 and May 2020. Apple released the iPhone 11 in September 2019, so the issue affects iPhone 11 devices made after launch. 

Owners with affected iPhone 11 devices should take up Apple's repair offer soon as the program only covers affected iPhone 11 devices for two years after it was sold at retail.

SEE: 5G smartphones: A cheat sheet (free PDF) (TechRepublic)

Apple notes that iPhone 11 devices with an already cracked screen will need to get that fixed before becoming eligible for the free repair. Those repairs could cost money. 

""If your iPhone 11 has any damage which impairs the ability to complete the repair, such as a cracked screen, that issue will need to be resolved prior to the service. In some cases, there may be a cost associated with the additional repair,"" Apple notes. 

Owners can check whether their iPhone 11 is eligible for a free repair by typing the device's serial number on to Apple's support page. 

This is a worldwide Apple program but it doesn't extend the standard warranty coverage of the iPhone 11.

Apple is also offering refunds to owners who believe their iPhone 11 was affected by this issue and had already paid for it to be repaired. People with an affected iPhone 11 can get the repairs done at an Apple retail store or an authorized Apple service provider. "

Apple currently has 20 such programs running. 

Here are the details.

Has the display of your iPhone 11 stopped responding? Apple has identified that devices manufactured between November 2019 and May 2020 may have an issue related to the display module.

Do your AirPods Pro crackle when in use? Apple has identified this as a problem affecting some earbuds and has kicked off a replacement program for affected devices.

If the screen on your iPad Air (3rd generation) has gone blank (with perhaps a brief flicker or flash may appear before the screen goes blank) and was manufactured between March 2019 and October 2019, these are eligible for a free of charge fix.

Some Smart Battery Cases made for iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR may experience charging issues, such as not charging or charging intermittently when plugged into power, or won't charge the iPhone or only does so intermittently.

iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus not powering on? If it was manufactured between October 2018 to August 2019 then it might be eligible for a free fix.

If a crack has formed along the rounded edge of the screen of the aluminum models of an Apple Watch Series 2 or Series 3, this could be as a result of a defect that Apple is aware of.

Apple has identified that some MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015) laptops sold between September 2015 and February 2017 may overheat and pose a fire safety risk.

Apple recommends users check their serial number against the database of affected devices, and if theirs is one of the affected units to stop using it and seek a free battery replacement.

This is a program that covers keyboard issues such as stuck, repeating, or malfunctioning keys on MacBook, MacBook Air, or MacBook Pro keyboards.

It covers the following devices:

 According to Apple, a small percentage of 13-inch MacBook Pro may experience display issues:

Affected devices were sold between October 2016 and February 2018.

Some three-prong UK/Singapore AC wall plugs shipped between 2003 to 2010 with Macs and some iOS devices, and also included in the Apple World Travel Adapter Kit, may break and become a shock hazard.

Some 128GB and 256GB solid-state drives (SSD) used in 13-inch MacBook Pro (non Touch Bar) laptops may be defective and result in data loss.

Some iPhone X displays may experience touch issues due to a component defect, resulting in either the display not responding to touch, or responding as though it was touched when it wasn't.

This relates to a logic board failure that can result in reboots, freezes, or bricked iPhones.

This relates to faulty batteries that can cause the battery to expand, and is limited to laptops sold between October 2016 and October 2017. Although this sounds dramatic, according to Apple it is not a safety issue.

A logic board failure can cause some iPhone 7 handsets to display ""No Service"" even if in cellular coverage. This affects iPhones sold between September 2016 and February 2018 in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Macao, and the U.S.

This is an odd one as it covers display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after the iPhone has been dropped multiple times on a hard surface. If your device fits the bill, and the device isn't broken or the screen cracked, Apple will carry out a repair for $149.

Some two-prong AC wall plugs designed for use in Continental Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Argentina and Brazil and sold between 2003 to 2015 with Macs, selected iOS devices, and Apple's World Travel Adapter Kit may break and be a shock hazard.

This relates to Beats Pill XL Speakers sold since January 2014. It appears the speaker may overheat and pose a fire safety risk. Apple is recalling these in exchange for Apple Store credit or electronic payment of $325 (or local equivalent).

This adapter, which was sold with the iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S models shipped between October 2009 to September 2012, has been shown to overheat and pose a safety risk.

This allows you to take counterfeit (or for that matter any third-party charger) iPhone, iPad, and iPod adapters to Apple and buy a genuine charger for the special price of $10.

This relates to the ultracompact Apple USB power adapter shipped with the iPhone 3GS in the US, Japan, Canada, Mexico, and several Latin American countries. It seems the metal prongs can break off in the wall socket, posing a serious shock risk."

I wouldn't say that any one bug is a widespread showstopper, but more a care of a lot of bugs, each affecting a subset of user.  

Bugs range from that constant companion, poor battery life, to more random bugs such as poor cell reception and problems with notifications not showing up.  

But help appears to be on the way, in the form of iOS 14.3.  

Must read: How to securely erase hard drives (HDDs) and solid state drives (SSDs) 

As of late, I've been recruiting a few people suffering from iPhone issues into a small, personal test group to see if their problems improve (don't worry, I outline the possible pitfalls, but switching to a public beta of a minor release is less problematic than doing the same with a major release).  

Here's how you go about installing the public beta on your iPhone.  

And on the whole, the response for iOS 14.3, especially the latest public beta 3, has been good.  

Here's what I've been hearing back from users.  

-       Battery life is improved  

-       Performance is ""less laggy"" on older iPhones  

-       Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, along with cellular, seems more stable  

-       Bugs, such as notifications not showing, seems to be fixed.  

Seems good. I've been running the beta on my main daily driver and overall compared to iOS 14.2 it does feel more refined and better finished.  

As usual, your mileage can -- and probably will -- vary.   

But if you are suffering, then you can either take your chances with iOS 14.3 beta, or wait until the final version is released soon.  "
12,https://www.zdnet.com/article/too-many-browser-tabs-this-favorite-extension-is-the-perfect-solution/,Too many browser tabs? This impressive extension is my favorite solution,"If you regularly find yourself opening so many browser tabs that you can't keep track of them all, you're not alone. There are plenty of extensions that promise to conquer tab overload, but my favorite, Workona, offers a feature set that others can't match.",Ed Bott,2020-12-03 15:16:00,The Ed Bott Report,"How many browser tabs do you have open right now? If you're like most people who spend their workday in front of a PC or Mac, the answer is probably ""too many to count,"" and you're staring right now at a row of icons that offer only the faintest clue of what's on the tab associated with each one.  

Good luck remembering what's on each page when all you can see are favicons for each tab

When tab overload strikes, the usual cure is to declare tab bankruptcy and just start over, which means scrolling through your browser's history to pick up where you left off or to find that fact you need for the report that's due before the end of the day.  

Also: Best VPN service in 2020: Safe and fast doesn't come for free  

Plenty of browser extensions promise to help you manage too-many-tabs syndrome, but most just offer an alternative view of all your open tabs: lists or thumbnails, for example, instead of tiny favicons. My favorite, a remarkable web-based service called Workona, takes a different approach. It offers a simplified way to view and organize browser tabs and bookmarks, then syncs your work across multiple devices, with options to share workspaces with co-workers. I've been using it for more than 18 months and it's enhanced my productivity more than any other tool I use.  

My favorite solution for keeping browser tabs under control is a browser extension that allows me to organize tabs into groups called workspaces, sync those saved workspaces across devices, share them with team members, and connect cloud-based productivity services for instant access. Extensions are available for Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox on all major desktop platforms, with versions for Safari (on MacOS and iOS) coming soon.

Pricing: Workona is currently in preview and all features are free, After it's officially released in 2021, the free version will include all tab management features and allow up to 10 workspaces, with an unlimited number of apps. The Pro version will cost $6 per month and support unlimited workspaces with priority support and additional premium features

Workona is developed by a small team (11 employees) based in San Mateo, Ca. I've been using the software for more than a year and a half and have been impressed by the steady improvements and reliable support. The company is well funded and has a solid roster of corporate clients.  

After you add a cloud app from this list, its icon appears in the sidebar on the left.

The combination of a cross-platform browser extension and cloud service is uncanny in its ability to remember every open tab. I've organized my bookmarks and projects into workspaces, which sync across multiple PCs and Macs. If I shut down the browser, my open tabs are restored when I restart, allowing me to pick up where I left off.  

It's easy to keep projects organized by dragging pages between workspaces, and you can pin frequently-used pages to a workspace and organize them into blocks so that they're easily accessible even after you close the tab. (Pages you pin to the browser window are available from any workspace.)  

The coolest feature is the ability to integrate cloud-based apps into a workspace, allowing you to create a new document, start a Zoom call, or work with an existing project in Github by clicking an icon in the sidebar on the left.  

One bonus from Workona's tab management features is improved performance, as the software suspends tabs in the background so they don't hog memory. You can configure the maximum number of tabs to allow in memory (by default, this number is set to 25) and automatically restore tabs in a suspended state so that they're ready to go when needed. If you already use the popular extension The Great Suspender, Workona will integrate with it.  

Also: The best password managers for business 

What really sets Workona apart from plain-vanilla tab management software is its support for collaboration features. You can share a workspace with other members of your organization or use an email link, and you can specify whether your co-workers are able to edit your workspace layout or not. One nice usability tweak for newcomers is a feature that offers to create starter workspaces based on your business type: law firms, for example, get document management templates that can be customized and duplicated for each client.

The glue that ties all these features together is an Omnibox-style search box that allows you to find any open tab, workspace, or saved resource. It also includes command-line options to create new resources on the fly. Even with a 10-workspace limitation, the free version of Workona can make a major dent in your tab-overload problem.   

TooManyTabs:  If all you want is tab management in Firefox or Chrome and you'd rather not pay for the privilege, this popular, time-tested extension is your best choice.  

Partizion:  ZDNet's Adrian Kingsley-Hughes raved about this Chrome-only extension recently. It offers a subset of Workona's organizational features at a cost of $4 per month.   "
13,https://www.zdnet.com/article/jason-squareds-top-5-tech-of-2020/,Top tech 2020: The two Jasons pick their favorite gear of the year,These are the tech products and innovations that most impressed Jason and Jason this year.,Jason Perlow,2020-12-03 12:20:00,Tech Broiler,"Our last show discussed the various companies and products that earned a Tech Turkey award, and there were some doozies. Now it's time to talk about what are, in our opinion, the top tech products or innovations in 2020. 

Here are five products that stood out to Jason Cipriani and me this year. 

Jason Cipriani: This is kind of like 5G, where not everyone or every device is going to be able to take advantage of it. I only started using Wi-Fi 6 in the last few weeks with the most recent Velop Mesh system. It's blown me away. For example, on the iPhone 12, it's not unheard of for me to get 700+ Mbps in speed tests. The problem right now is that most tech we have in our homes doesn't use Wi-Fi 6, so the incentive to go out and upgrade today isn't there. However, the availability of both Wi-Fi 6 devices and Wi-F i6 routers has significantly expanded this year and will have a big impact on the home office, remote learning, etc., over the next year. 

Jason Perlow: The speed of Wi-Fi 6, which is also referred to as 802.11ax, is not the only significant advancement of the new high-speed wireless networking standard. It's also security, in the form of WPA3, which is a requirement of all Wi-Fi 6 equipment when they are certified. WPA3 is a major improvement over WPA2 in current routers because it uses a new authentication mechanism, known as SAE or Simultaneous Authentication of Equals to replace the PSK or Pre-Shared-Key in WPA2, which is a much more secure key exchange method. It makes it much more difficult for an attacker to record the session's encrypted transmission and then play it back offline to attempt to crack it. Some existing Wi-Fi5/802.11ac routers support WPA3 experimentally now, so if you can turn it on and you have products that support it, such as any iOS 13 or iOS 14, or any Android later than 10 or even Windows 10 2004, you can use that protocol.

Our pick for the best Wi-Fi 6 router this year is the Linksys Velop MX12600 mesh system. Amazon's Eero Pro 6, looks promising as well, pending further review.

Jason Cipriani: Perhaps a surprise entry, but I think the Fold 2 deserves a spot because Samsung took the original fold -- a device Samsung had to pull from stores a few days before launch -- reworked it, got it in good enough shape to release, and then kept iterating. At the time, I said it should have just canceled the phone, gone back to the drawing board, and tried again when the tech was ready. But Samsung proved me wrong, releasing the Z Fold 2 this year, with an improved experience overall. I think most of, if not all, reviews were very positive.

Foldable phones are indeed in our future, and Samsung is currently leading the way. 

Jason Perlow: So I am not a folding phone user yet because these things are just too darned expensive right now. However, I think Samsung is making some critical innovations in the space. It looks like Samsung managed to address most of the previous model's issues, including any performance and usability compromises it had. It is making progress, and for that, it should be recognized.

Jason Cipriani: Google finally got TV right. A Chromecast device with an easy to understand UI and a remote for $50… enough said. 

Jason Perlow: Look, to be honest, I was skeptical of Google being able to release a decent streaming set-top box, especially when you see how strong Roku, Amazon, and even Apple is in that space. Honestly, I wanted not to like it. But not only did I like it, I liked it even better than Amazon's comparable offering this year, which was slower, had less memory, just didn't have as slick an interface. So, now, I'm using it as my only streaming box in my living room. The only downside right now is the lack of Apple TV+ support, but I suspect that will be addressed at some point. The product is an excellent value for what it is if you are looking for a streaming device that supports just about all of the major services. And, as I discovered recently, you can even pair it with Bluetooth devices, such as headphones, so you don't wake up your family late at night when you're binging your favorite show.

Jason Cipriani: The way I review phones has changed a lot over the years, but that's because phones changed. There used to be a big focus on camera capabilities once phones started to get good enough to replace most point and shoot cameras. Then, the competition kind of leveled off, and it was almost a given that a camera on a flagship phone was going to impress. Each release is more impressive than the last, but only incrementally for those who look closely. With the 12 Pro Max, and to that extent, the 12 Pro, the camera is a giant leap forward. I took it out the other day to take photos for our Christmas cards, and I honestly don't think I'll ever take out my expensive camera again. It was much easier to hold up the phone, snap a couple of photos, and not have to think about adjusting ISO or shutter speed. Tap on the screen to change focus, hit the shutter button, and enjoy. 

Jason Perlow: So, look, Apple has been ahead of the game with its iPhone cameras since last year's 11 Pro Max; it completely blew away anything Samsung or Google had. The only vendor it was on par or possibly even behind was Huawei, and frankly, it isn't even in the picture right now. So, it's safe to say, if you are someone where photography is paramount for you in a mobile device, the iPhone 12 Pro Max is your only logical choice. What the company is doing with its microprocessors and machine learning is astounding for computational photography. Which brings us to...

Jason Cipriani: Apple had a tremendous year. Seriously, we saw more innovation out of Apple this year than we have in the last couple of years -- possibly combined. The ability to pull off a processor switch, where the underlying architecture is entirely different, and making it almost seamless for developers still blows my mind. 

I think about the approach Microsoft is taking with the Surface Pro X, easing into the ARM switch in public, through a beta… and then I look at what Apple did, making the entire transition behind closed doors and releasing it on day one, ready to go. Man, it's impressive. Everyone else in the computer industry is so far behind right now. 

Jason Perlow: I don't know where to begin with how amazed I am by this thing. I hate to start playing Apple word bingo, but that chip is astounding and magical. Cupertino put a tremendous amount of resources into it. Apple was able to take a processor architecture that was once only reserved for low power, mobile devices, and smartphone-types of application workloads and transform it into the future of desktop computing. 

Everyone needs to notice this because we all thought it would take a long time before Arm chips were on parity with Intel. We have seen with this hybrid SoC architecture from Apple a much more optimized chip for modern workloads. It is much more efficient with memory and power use and can run apps not only just as fast as Intel, but run them even faster depending on what they are and how the code is built. The open-source machine learning benchmarks on the chip using TensorFlow are off the scale, and even Arm Windows virtualized and emulated runs faster than what Microsoft's Surface Pro X can do with the Qualcomm SQ2 chip. 

Hopefully, the success of the M1 encourages processor designers such as Nvidia, which now owns Arm, to create other Arm-based desktop-grade processors that are licensable. And, potentially, there are also RISC designs such as OpenPower and RISC-V that are open source that pave the way for future non-Intel chips in the datacenter or even on the desktop, too.

This year, our choice for the best Mac for the money is, without doubt, the 2020 M1 Mac Mini."

JetBrains is the designer behind Kotlin, the Google-endorsed programming language for Android app development that's compatible with Java. 

The company has been working on Jetpack Compose for Desktop, a UI framework for Kotlin apps that helps developers build slick user interfaces (UI) for apps. 

SEE: Managing and troubleshooting Android devices checklist (TechRepublic Premium)

It launched the open-source project off the back of Google's Jetpack Compose, a UI toolkit that builds on Android Jetpack, which itself is a set of software libraries for Android app development done in Kotlin. 

As Google describes it, Jetpack Compose combines application programming interfaces (APIs), Kotlin, and a reactive programming model.  

Google released the alpha version of Jetpack Compose in August but first took the wraps off Jetpack at its 2018 I/O conference and has been working on improvements ever since via new libraries. Jetpack is used by more than 80% of the top 1,000 Android apps.  

Jetpack Compose for Desktop aims to extend the promise of Jetpack beyond Android to macOS, Linux, and Windows. The software helps developers build UIs in Kotlin and run them on these desktop platforms. 

As with Kotlin, a key feature is interoperability with Java, in this case Oracle's Swing UI toolkit for Java.  

JetBrains' Android-to-desktop development program is still in its early stages, but it promises to help developers exploit Oracle's Swing to ""mix Compose elements with regular Swing elements and gradually migrate their existing applications to Compose for Desktop"". 

It also introduces early support for Apple's M1 chip that lets apps built with Compose for Desktop run on new Apple hardware with ""native speed"".  

Other additions include the support for Gradle versions 6.6 and 6.7, improved interoperability with JavaFX, and simplified reuse of icon assets between platforms. 

""We at JetBrains felt that design decisions made in Android Jetpack Compose by Google including the UI-as-code approach would make it a successful UI library even beyond Android space,"" says Nikolay Igotti, JetBrains development team lead.  

""And we build a lot of desktop products ourselves, many of them in Kotlin and on the JVM platform, so having a modern UI library for the Kotlin/JVM platform is important for us."" 

SEE: Keeping data flowing could soon cost billions, business warned

The company wanted to have a UI library for both Kotlin and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) platform to support its ambitions to be an important language for desktop development as well as mobile. Jetpack Compose was inspired by Google's Flutter UI app development framework and React.  

JetBrains has bundled Jetpack Compose for Desktop to version 2020.3 of its IntelliJ IDEA, the latest version of its popular integrated development environment.  "

With recent tests showing that putting Windows onto Apple Silicon absolutely spanks the performance currently available on Qualcomm-made processors, one could be forgiven for thinking Qualcomm was apprehensive about its future desktop prospects. 

However, Qualcomm SVP and general manager for mobile, compute, and infrastructure Alex Katouzian told journalists on Wednesday that Apple's new chip was a validation for putting mobile chips into laptops. 

""As we've seen during the pandemic age and I think this is going to continue for many years to come, video conferencing and remote working locations are going to become more and more important which means you have to have the capability of great video conferencing, you have to have the camera capability, you have to have the longevity of the battery, you should be able to work from any place that you are, inside your house or outside your house, and reach your work environment in a secure fashion,"" he said. 

""All of those things are validation of what we've been preaching and I think the strength is going to come from the fact that our partnership with Microsoft is going to be much stronger and extended into the future.  

""I think many, many parties realise that the Windows-based ecosystem needs a boost like this, and we're the partner of choice to make that happen -- so, it's a great opportunity and a great validation for Qualcomm."" 

Hours earlier, Qualcomm took the wraps off its new Snapdragon 888 chip, which will support 5G at millimetre-wave and sub-6GHz frequencies on ""all major bands worldwide"". It will also support carrier aggregation, standalone and non-standalone modes, and dynamic spectrum sharing. 

The company said it ""completely re-engineered"" its Hexagon processor that can now perform at 26 tera operations per second and updated its Sensing Hub to allow for lower-power, always-on AI processing. 

On the image front, the chip can capture photos and video at 2.7 gigapixels per second, a 35% boost on the prior generation. 

A notable absence among the list of Android phone makers that said they would use the 888 was Samsung. Those on the list included Asus, Lenovo, LG, Meizu, Motorola, Nubia, Realme, OnePlus, Oppo, Sharp, Vivo, Xiaomi, and ZTE. 

Last month, it was reported the United States had granted approval to Qualcomm to sell 4G chips for mobile phones to Huawei.  

Speaking on Wednesday, Qualcomm president Cristiano Amon said the company was in the fortunate position of being able to ""meet the objectives of both sides"" of the trade war. 

""We look at ourselves as probably a company that provides a lot of stability ... in our sector of technology between the two countries, so I think if you look in the essence of our business model, we have a licensing business model. We don't need to transfer technology. We open license that technology, and there's respect of intellectual property which is consistent with some of the United States' claims,"" Amon said. 

""I think all of our customers in China are licensed, and when we see the respect of intellectual property, we provide export of semiconductors which is in, from my United States perspective, it's in the direction of increasing commerce of exports to China. 

""We allow the China ecosystem with the Belt and Road Initiative building, on our platform, the mobile ecosystem of China to not only support the transition of China domestic to 5G, but to expand to other markets."" "

But I've discovered three tweaks that have helped me get more out of each charge.,Adrian Kingsley-Hughes,2020-12-01 15:43:10,Hardware 2.0,"iOS 14 was released in September, and here we are in December and users continue to complain about poor battery life. Now iOS 14.2 is out (or iOS 14.2.1 if you are running an iPhone 12 or iPhone 12 Pro) and I'm still hearing from people who feel that their battery life has taken a big hit since installing the update.

But I've found three things that have helped me get more out of each recharge, and help me make it through the day.

Must read: Top 10 Google Chrome plugins for 2020

I've noticed that the more widgets I use, the more battery life takes a hit. I don't find the built-in widgets that come with iOS to be too bad for battery life (although even they can be buggy), but third-party apps can be problematic.

Identifying a rogue widget is easy -- delete it and see if the problem goes away (or gets a little better).

If battery life has gotten worse since installing iOS 14, widgets would be the first thing that I'd be looking at.

Switching to Safari makes a massive difference if you browse a lot. For me, switching -- temporarily -- from Chrome to Safari added about an hour of battery life. 

Safari has always been better in terms of battery life, but the gulf between the two has grown significantly in iOS 14.

Same goes, to a lesser extent, for Mail versus Gmail, or Calendar versus Google Calendar. It might seem like I'm picking on Google apps, but these are the apps I use the most, and they're the ones where I can see the difference. 

For better battery life, go with the stock apps.

Ever since Apple introduced the Battery pane in Settings that allows users to see what is draining the battery the most, I've known that no cell coverage eats at the battery. If there's poor cell coverage, the iPhone works harder to try to establish a cell connection. It's that simple, and there's no free lunch.

The more work your smartphone has to do, the more battery is used.

But something's changed.

Under iOS 13, no cell coverage would account for about 2 percent of battery usage over the course of a normal day. Now there are days when I see this taking as much as 10 percent, with 8 percent now being normal. 

No Cell Coverage battery drain under iOS 14 appears much higher than before.

Nothing else has changed, and it's pretty consistent that I have to conclude that this is an issue with iOS 14. 

So, what's the solution? Well, I've found that turning off cellular when I'm in a dark spot helps a bit, as does leaving my phone in areas of my home and office where the strongest cell signal can be found. 

These help, but they have their limitations."

Not this year, Apple says, in its less-than-traditional holiday ad.",Chris Matyszczyk,2020-12-01 14:35:00,Technically Incorrect,"Please don't worry. There's a happy ending. Well, happyish.

In the cage match of Santa vs Fauci, the latter has some persuasive moves.

America's foremost epidemiologist predicts a ""surge upon surge"" of the coronavirus as we approach Christmas. What can Santa say to counter that? Somehow, ho-ho-ho doesn't necessarily cut it.

It seems, indeed, that Apple has already flipped to Fauci's side. 

Its new Holiday ad offers no families, no hugging, and certainly no mistletoe-inspired mischief. 

Instead, here's North Philadelphia-based rapper Tierra Whack finding the spirit of Christmas decidedly muted.

Yes, of course, she has her AirPods to help her wander through the streets alone. Still, she doesn't feel good and doesn't want to lie about it. 

No, she's not wearing a mask, which might upset Dr. Fauci. On the other hand, Whack's scarf gets so long that it begins to cover her mouth and nose. Why? Because this is art.

She gets home, to a lonely apartment. She doesn't want to be judged, she raps, she just wants to be herself.

Being yourself isn't so easy right now. Many people are being encouraged to think of others before they're overwhelmingly themselves, a spirit that hasn't quite been embraced by musicians such as Cardi B and Rita Ora.

Whack, though, is just herself and her music and that may not be enough. She has a large, traditional HomePod. She tells traditional Siri to ""turn it way up.""

This, for reasons of artistic symbolism, causes the HomePod to explode and leave behind a HomePod Mini.

What could this mean? That the traditional HomePod was never really all that? That Siri has a secret self-destruct button? That Apple's Holiday ad is nakedly commercialistic? 

But wait, the Mini is your path to a new, smaller you. A smaller you that's more positive and feistier. Soon, this mini-you will have maxi-you dancing around your apartment, comforted by the knowledge that your smaller self is your better self.

""I don't wanna be judged, I just want to be me,"" croons Whack again. In which case, avoid contact with other humans at all costs.

Continues our protagonist: ""You gotta be the one that people look up to."" It seems that Apple thinks the way you'll be looked up to is if you stay at home this Christmas, just you, your little self, and your HomePod Mini.

Who am I to say Apple is wrong? The creation, though, of a mini-person is one of advertising's more tiresome tropes. If Mobil 1 has done it, why would you stoop to it? 

Moreover, it's unlike Apple -- or, frankly, any other advertiser -- to ask people to live a little smaller.

Still, it's admirable that Apple isn't, for once, trying to gloss over reality and make us believe in too syrupy a world. Well, not entirely. The ad still offers the slightly hoary message that music will be our salvation.

I don't wanna be judged, but I think it's going to take a little more than that. My mini-me agrees."

Thanks to COVID-19, the world has had better years than the disaster that was 2020. The global pandemic may also be having a dramatic impact on smartphone lineups in 2021, by accelerating consumers' shift from high-end to mid-range phones that have capable processors and cameras to take decent photos and video, possibly on a 5G network. 

Reuters reports that Samsung may discontinue its Galaxy Note phone in 2021. If it were to launch, the next Galaxy Note would be called the Galaxy Note 21. 

SEE: 5G smartphones: A cheat sheet (free PDF) (TechRepublic)

Discontinuing the Galaxy Note would be a major marker in the history of smartphones. 

The Galaxy Note proved Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was wrong when he announced the 3.5-inch screen iPhone 4 in mid-2010 and mocked Android rivals –   mostly Samsung – for creating big-screen phones that people couldn't get their hands around. 

Samsung released the Galaxy Note a year later, simultaneously debunking Jobs' argument and creating the phablet category that Apple would later emulate with the iPhone 6 Plus in 2014. The Galaxy Note is known for its large screen and a stylus. 

But back then Samsung aspired to create a tablet-like experience in a smartphone. These days, its focus is on high-end smartphones in the foldable category, such as the Galaxy Fold and the $2,000 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2. 

According to Reuters, Samsung does not intend to develop a new Galaxy Note for 2021, citing three unnamed sources who claim to know about the South Korean multinational's plans. 

Samsung instead will make a Galaxy S 21 with a stylus and a new foldable with a stylus that will be sold separately. Reuters reports that Samsung is redirecting engineering efforts from the Note to new foldable smartphones. 

As ZDNet's Jason Perlow argued in August, ""phablets are so pre-pandemic"" due to the emergence of cheap phones and cheap tablets. 

SEE: Huawei ban: Big fines for telecoms companies if they ignore new security standards

The Samsung Note 20 Ultra, for example, has a hefty 6.87-inch screen but it and the iPhone 12 Pro Max break the $1,000 barrier significantly. The iPhone XR –   a cut below the iPhone 11 –   meanwhile became Apple's best-selling iPhone. 

And that was before the pandemic, which forced people who were once focused on mobile computing to sit tight and work at home for the foreseeable future. 

The Galaxy Note 20 Ultra significantly   breaks the $1,000 price barrier.  "

At AWS re:Invent, the cloud giant said it will offer EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instances to run on demand macOS workloads. The EC2 Mac instances don't cover Apple's M1 processor, which is powering the new MacBook Pro, MacBook Air and Mac Mini, until 2021 but it could be a game changer. 

What does Apple need to transition away from Intel as fast as possible? Scale so developers can write apps natively for Apple Silicon. AWS will offer that scale. 

AWS's blog walks through the Mac instances on-demand detail, but the most important takeaway is this: ""EC2 Mac instances with the Apple M1 chip are already in the works and planned for 2021.""

According to AWS, the EC2 Mac instances are built on Mac Mini devices and can be used to create apps for Apple devices ranging from iPhone and iPad to Mac and Apple Watch.

The Mac instances are enabled by AWS' Nitro platform, which rides shotgun with AWS' own Arm based Graviton2 processors.

With Apple's new M1 Arm-based system on chip, Mac users who need to use Windows 10 can't run Microsoft's Arm-based version of Windows using Apple's Bootcamp.  

The key obstacle is that Microsoft doesn't license Windows 10 on Arm to any entities other than its own Surface group and Windows 10 on Arm OEMs like HP, Asus and Lenovo.    

SEE: Windows 10 Start menu hacks (TechRepublic Premium) 

Technically, there's nothing stopping owners of the M1 MacBook Air, MacBook Pro 13-inch or Mac mini from running Windows 10 on Arm, as Apple's software engineering chief Craig Federighi recently pointed out. 

""We have the core technologies for them to do that, to run their Arm version of Windows, which in turn of course supports x86 user mode applications. But that's a decision Microsoft has to make, to bring to license that technology for users to run on these Macs. But the Macs are certainly very capable of it,"" said Federighi. 

But Microsoft's reluctance to create a license for Windows 10 on Arm for end users hasn't stopped creative engineers from putting together a working example of what things could be like if it did.  

AWS principal engineer Alexander Graf did just that, using the open-source QEMU virtualization software for Windows on Arm. QEMU emulates access to hardware such as the CPU and GPU. Graf's work was spotted by The 8-bit, via 9to5Mac.  

""Who said Windows wouldn't run well on #AppleSilicon? It's pretty snappy here,"" Graf wrote in a tweet.   

Graf previously worked on the Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) for Linux distribution SUSE for over a decade. He also worked on the SUSE Arm team to bring ""openSUSE and SLES to all Arm platforms where it made sense"", according to Graf's Linkedin profile. And he worked on Mac OS X virtualization using KVM.  

Now he's a KVM developer at AWS, which today announced new Mac instances for AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) based on Nitro System, an AWS hypervisor for EC2 instances.   

AWS EC2 Mac instances with the Apple M1 chip ""are already in the works, and planned for 2021"". But the current AWS offering include instances of 8th generation, six-core Intel Core i7 processors running at 3.2GHz. The instances allow developers to run applications for the Apple's macOS, iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, watchOS, and Safari. 

SEE: Digital transformation: The new rules for getting projects done 

A developer using the handle @imbushuo on Twitter has posted Geekbench versions 4 and 5 scores that compare Windows 10 on Arm on an M1 computer with the Microsoft-made Surface Pro X.  

Windows on an M1 got a single-core score of 1,288 and multi-core score of 5,685 whereas the Surface Pro X's scores were roughly 800 and 3,000 in those respective benchmarks. Per MSpoweruser, the Surface Pro X benchmark was made using the SQ2 Arm-based chip that was co-developed by Qualcomm and Microsoft for Microsoft's latest Surface Pro X computers.    

The benchmarks don't bode well for Microsoft's Windows on Arm ambitions to create an ecosystem of Windows OEMs if Apple's new in-house M1 chips make Macs the highest-performing hardware for running Windows on Arm. "

While the new Apple iPhone 12 models are now available at full price, there are an assortment of other phones available during Black Friday and Cyber Monday that can save you hundreds. Many of these special offers are available now and expire at the end of November.

We've reviewed many of these phones on ZDNet in 2020 and the majority are unlocked so should work with most carriers in the US. There are also several carrier specials available, but they are specific to opening new lines of service, purchasing phones as part of a buy-one-get-one (BOGO) special, and offering high value for trade-ins. We recommend you check out your preferred carrier for possible sale offers.

After reading an earlier version of this article a reader recommended I check out the Black Friday deals over on the Google Fi website. As a result, I canceled my Pixel 5 order and placed an order for a Pixel 4a 5G. It was $150 off for existing Google Fi customers and $200 off for new customers.

The Pixel 4a 5G is an affordable phone from Google with the latest, and arguably best, camera software on a phone today. It offers solid battery life,  6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and 6.2-inch display. It doesn't have wireless charging or water resistance, but it's tough to beat at that price.

In addition to the Google Pixel 4a 5G deal, Google has great discounts ranging from $100 to $500 off with activation on Google Fi. There are deals on the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, S20, and A71, as well as a couple of Motorola phone deals. You must check out these Google Fi deals.

I've been waiting for some kind of deal on Google's latest 5G smartphone and with Black Friday we see Google offer $50 off of the Pixel 5. If you are a Google One subscriber you can also get 10% back on your purchase to use for a case, accessory, or other item in the Google Store since there are non-phone items also on sale.

The Google Pixel 5 isn't the most powerful smartphone, when it comes to specifications, but it has arguably the best camera system on a phone, brings 5G to the table, and is fairly affordable at $699 ($649 for Black Friday). You should still receive this phone in time for the Christmas holiday, but you better order one fast.

Given the extremely poor battery life of the Pixel 4, you should probably consider trading it in for the Pixel 5 which will save you even more money. The Pixel 5 is available in two colors with one storage option and one size.

OnePlus launched a couple of new flagship phones a few months ago and this holiday season is offering $100 off both of its flagship models. The OnePlus 8 Pro starts at $799 with the discount while the OnePlus 8 starts at $599. These are very powerful 5G smartphones and $100 savings makes them even better.

The sale is available now and runs through the end of November. Super fast charging, fluid high refresh rate displays, 5G, and zippy performance are key aspects of these two phones.

Motorola's foldable phone provides new technology in a form factor similar to the Razr line from the past. The new flip phone sports 5G and design improvements for 2020. $400 off is a major savings and the unlocked version at B&H Photo should work just one on the carrier of your choice.

Morotola also has several other phones with discounts for the holiday season. Discounts range from $70 to $300 off.

Unless you have an urgent need for a new Samsung phone right at launch, you should always wait a couple of months to realize some savings. Samsung is offering the new Note 20 Ultra for $200 off.

The Note 20 Ultra is a fantastic device for S Pen users and one of the best Samsung phones available today. The phone sports a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor, 12GB of RAM, 120 Hz display, and 4500 mAh battery. Samsung uses the fastest RAM and fastest internal storage technology too so it remains one of the best phones available for business.

Samsung followed up its typical Galaxy announcements of the S series and Note series with the S20 FE lineup. FE is an abbreviation for Fan Edition and the phone appeals to Samsung fans with lovely colors, powerful specifications, and a rather affordable price. A $50 savings is appealing for this new phone, sold directly from Samsung.

Six colors are available to choose from and there are very few compromises made for a phone at this price. 5G, triple rear cameras, a high-resolution display, and more are provided on a phone starting at $600. Phones like this make it tough to justify spending $1,000 or more on a smartphone today.

Samsung S-series flagship from early 2020 remains one of the most capable smartphones available today and for the holidays Samsung is offering $150 off the S20 Ultra 5G. The phone has one of the most capable zoom lenses on a phone today, even if the 100x is a bit of a novelty.

You can play Xbox games on the phone now thanks to Android support for Xbox Game Pass and the powerful processor with gorgeous display of the S20 Ultra 5G.

24,https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-m1-macs-are-no-ipad-killers/,The M1 Macs are no iPad killers,"While they are arriving as the perceived competitive value of the iPad Pro is at a lull, the new MacBooks may help drive sophistication of iPad apps.",Ross Rubin,2020-11-30 20:23:00,Apple,"Prior to the launch of the game-changing but not price-changing M1 MacBooks, I wrote about how their launch would put alleviate pressure on the iPad to fulfill the needs of those wanting a laptop that blended the performance per watt of the Apple's tablet with the work style, applications, and relative openness of its laptops. 

But, earlier this week, fellow ZDNet contributor Robin Harris went much further in comparing Apple's elite portable computers, alleging that the M1 MacBook will put the hurt on the iPad Pro after conducting a point-by-point comparison. Indeed, it's been a tough fall for Apple's highest-end iPads, with the revamped iPad Air coming closer to the industrial design of Apple's iPad flagship while slipping features that may have marginal appeal such as the LIDAR sensor, quad speakers, and Face ID. (The latter, of course, has at least temporarily fallen out of favor in an age of facial coverings.) 

But if the M1 Macs have an Achilles' heel, it is in their selection of and compatibility with iPad apps; the two limitations may be related. iPad developers can choose whether to list their iPad apps in the Mac App Store. Some may be holding off for business reasons; the M1 Macs, especially for now, provide a limited incremental market. But others may be holding off because they want to improve the experience before listing. And yet others may be evaluating Catalyst, Apple's option for turning an iPad app into a genuine Mac app that can run on the much larger installed base of Intel-based Macs as well as the first and future Macs with Apple silicon.

Apple's support of native iPad apps on the Mac represents those apps coming full-circle. After years of exhorting developers to optimize iPad apps for a new world of multitouch-driven, cursor-free sparse interfaces, Apple shifted gears as it literally grounded the iPad with its own line of keyboards and, with them, the implied need for keyboard control and keyboard shortcuts. Apple followed up by experimental and then standard cursor support. Many developers have been slow to take Apple up on the suggestion. Indeed, there's still a large number of iPhone apps that still don't even have a native iPad version and can sometimes make for a frustrating experience when they don't accommodate landscape mode for keyboard use. (And if these developers haven't been enticed by now, it's hard to imagine that they ever will.)

But those who go through the effort of modernizing their app to support good behavior on the Mac will also support features such as split-screen and keyboard equivalents; these are more likely to be used on iPads with larger displays and keyboards, in other words, the higher end of the iPad line. Access to the Mac market will also open these apps up to Mac-first and Mac-only competition, which could spur developers to add features heretofore missing from the iPad versions of their apps.

We could see further development of ""pro"" app versions that are more geared toward iPad Pro-Mac scenarios versus standard versions more geared toward iPhone-baseline iPad scenarios. For example, while the largest iPad Pro has more than enough screen real estate to support a desktop Mac app like Twitter's multi-column Tweetdeck client, Twitter offers only a version of the iPhone-derived, single-column interface for the iPad.

Apple couldn't be happier if it turns out the strongest competition for the iPad is the Mac. To date, the iPad has thrived in a world where the Mac already existed, but which couldn't compete on factors that boil down to better performance per watt. Now, the Mac has more than evened that playing field. Its apps may not be optimized for iPad Pro-like usage scenarios but can provide a gateway to drive app improvements on the iPad.

Apple Silicon MacBooks will be the laptops that iPads were never supposed to be Arm-based MacBooks could steal back some thunder from the iPad, but much depends on how Apple prices them.

M1 Macs: The opportunities Apple seized and sacrificed For Apple, Job 1 in the M1 transition was to prove out the case for switching with minimal disruption. But the company stopped short on capitalizing on some Arm benefits pursued by Microsoft and Qualcomm.

I caught up with John Hancock Life Insurance CEO Brooks Tingle to talk about the company's partnerships with Fitbit, Apple Watch and Amazon Halo to connect customer experience, actuarial data and technology.  

Why life insurance and wearable device data? Tingle said wearable data allows John Hancock to connect with customers more often and have more touch points. Tingle said: 



                        Own your well-being
                    


Healthline cuts through the confusion with straightforward, expert-reviewed, person-first experiences — all designed to help you make the best decisions.

Economics. Tingle said John Hancock doesn't shy away from the economic benefits of having life insurance customers live a long life. Tingle said:

John Hancock's Vitality program. Tingle noted that Vitality is part game and part frequent flyer program. ""You get points for doing things that correlate with a longer, healthier life: physical activity, good nutrition, seeing your doctor, good sleep, things like that,"" said Tingle. ""When we launched the program in 2015, we thought about the major pillars of living a longer, healthier life: physical activity, nutrition, preventative screenings."" 

Wearable device choice. Vitality started in 2015 with Fitbit, which was a pioneer of corporate wellness programs. Today John Hancock supports Apple Watch as well as Amazon Halo in addition to Fitbit. Tingle said: 

Best feature. Tingle said some of the best app features for Vitality came as a surprise. The Vitality Wheel is a feature where a customer spins for a wheel every 10th workout completed.  

Datasets and how it varies by device. Tingle said:

Nutrition tracking. Tingle said nutrition has historically been a tough thing to track given that it isn't a data set for wearables. Nutrition tracking is typically based on self reporting. As a result, Vitality tries to encourage healthy eating with discounts and education. ""We are triangulating around the medical science, the actuarial science, behavioral science, which is what are people actually going to do,"" said Tingle.  

Mental wellness. Tingle said data tracking on mental wellness involves multiple components. He said: 

Vitality and digital transformation. Tingle said that the Vitality experience has influenced John Hancock's approach to life insurance overall. Tingle noted that there's more work to do with digital transformation in throughout the buying process.

But how do you get to all that content? After more than 10 years of streaming, I know a thing or two about streaming devices. Here's my pick of the best.

I also know streaming services. I recently reviewed both the best free streaming services and best subscription-based live TV streaming services. You'll also soon be seeing my pick of the best Video-on-Demand (VoD) services. In short, I know my way around streaming.

You may be thinking, ""Why bother with a streaming device? Can't I get all the streaming services I want from a smart TV? Actually, no, no you can't.

I wish you could, but today smart TVs are still a poor choice. That's because, generally speaking, TV manufacturers do a poor job of supporting streaming services. For example, last year, older smart TVs from Samsung and Vizio stopped supporting Netflix. If they can do that to Netflix, the most popular of all subscription-based video streaming services, you know they'll neglect other services as well.  

Some smart TVs also don't support newer channels. For example, if your kids are demanding Frozen 2 on Disney+ and you have a non-supported Vizio Smartcast TV, you'll have to explain to your five-year-old that they can't watch Anna, Else, and Olaf after all. Good luck with that.

A related problem is that smart TVs don't tend to support the more obscure channels. For example, I like the sport cricket, so I subscribe to Willow TV. If there's a smart TV out there, which supports it, I haven't found it yet. 

Eventually. true streaming devices may become obsolete. We're not there yet. 

Besides, it's a lot cheaper to buy a new streaming gadget than it to buy a new TV.  So, before you buy any of these, if you like a particular, non-mainstream streaming service, make sure your device supports it. Only Roku supports pretty much everything and anything. And, even then, thanks to business fights, some services may not be supported. For example, until recently, you couldn't get HBO Max or Peacock on a Roku. 

So, with all that in mind, let's dig into today's best streamers.

If you want the best possible quality from a Roku device, you want the 2020 Roku Ultra. But, if you want the best deal for the money, you want the Roku Streaming Stick+.

For a list price of $50, you get Roku's easy-to-use interface and access to over 5,000 streaming services. And, yes, as of late November 2020, that includes HBO Max and NBC's Peacock. 

The Stick+ streams 4K and High Dynamic Range (HDR) video. Like all Roku devices, it includes the best streaming service search function of all streaming devices. 

The remote, which now includes a TV volume and power control, is also easy to use. Thanks to its Advanced Wireless Receiver, you can control your viewing experience from anywhere in your living room or even the largest home theater. 

As an option, you can also get the remote with earbud headphones. With this, you can watch the show you want without bugging your spouse who's reading next to you.

Really, there's no reason to look any further if all you want is an excellent video streamer. The Roku Streaming Stick+ is the best of the best.

What's that you want the Rolls-Royce of streaming devices? In that case, you'll want Roku's latest of its top-of-the-line streaming device: The 2020 Roku Ultra.

For a list price of $100, the Roku Ultra has everything the Stick+ and more. Like what? I'll tell you.

In addition to 4K and HDR, the Ultra also supports Dolby Vision and three-dimensional audio Dolby Atmos acoustics on compatible TVs. With the right television, sound system, and video content you'll get the best possible streaming experience.

Notice I said with the ""right"" equipment and set up. Most new high-end TVs support Dolby Vision, with the notable exception of Samsung, which supports its own HDR10+ format. Dolby Vision will give you a slightly better HDR experience than generic HDR. Dolby Atmos is a surround sound format. It goes beyond Dolby Digital's 5.1-channels to add ""height"" audio channels for improved realism.  The only way you can experience this is with a home theater audio rig setup to use it. To do that, the Ultra will be the cheapest component of your home theater by an order of magnitude. 

The streaming device supports 802.11ac for an excellent high-speed Wi-Fi connection. It also comes with an Ethernet port, if you want the security of a wired network connection. Personally, I prefer the Ethernet port. 

It also includes a USB port. With it, you can connect an external hard drive or a Network-Attached Storage (NAS) so you can watch your own video library. That way you don't need to worry about setting up a media server. Personally, I prefer setting running my own Plex server so I can watch my collection of 30s and 40s movies no matter where I am in my home. But you can't beat just plugging in your video collection into the USB port for ease of use. 

Finally, the Ultra's remote now has two customizable buttons to open your favorite channels. This is in addition to the default buttons for Netflix, Hulu, Sling TV, and Vudu. 

If you want the best possible streaming experience, and you have the rest of the home theater gear to go with it, get the Ultra. It's that simple.

I've been a fan of the Google Chromecast since day one back in 2013. All it could do was mirror my Android smartphone and tablet's screens and my Chrome web browser's display to my TV. That was it. Screencasting, as it's been come to be known, is actually pretty powerful. But, this fall, Google decided to make the Chromecast, under the name Chromecast with Google TV, a full-fledged streaming device.

This next-generation Chromecast now comes with a remote. Earlier versions required you to use your Android device to control it. This remote also supports TV power and volume controls. It also lets you change your TV inputs making it something of a simple universal remote. Although if you want a true high-powered universal remote, you'll still want to buy a Logitech $70 Harmony 665 or $250 Harmony 950. 

Like the Roku Ultra, it supports 4K UHD streaming with HDR and Dolby Vision video support for video and no holds barred Dolby Atmos for outstanding sound. It also comes with the Google TV interface. Behind that, you'll find the Android operating system with over 6,500 Android TV apps.

It's best feature, however, is that while other streaming devices make you hop from service to service to find your show. (Example: Is The Queen's Gambit on Netflix or Amazon Prime? Netflix.) On Google, all your favorite shows, across all your streaming services, are shown on one screen. It's a killer feature.

Last, but never least, it has a list price of $49.99. With all that, you may wonder why I still prefer the Roku models. Frankly, the only reason at this point is that Roku has a long track history, while this radical new Chromecast is only a few months old. All other things being equal, by this time next year, Chromecast with Google TV may well be my first choice.

The Amazon Fire TV Cube (2nd Gen) comes with Alexa built-in. Now, I was an Amazon Echo user from the start, so I'm fine with that. If you're not, keep looking. But if you're OK with Alexa listening in, then you should check out the latest generation Fire Cube. 

This $120 list price version of the Fire TV Cube is faster than its ancestor. It also supports 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Atmos. It's also one of the few devices that supports Samsung's HDR10+. 

It and the rest of the Amazon Fire TV devices also --finally -- support YouTube and YouTube TV. For a long time, Amazon and Google were squabbling, and even though you could get Amazon Prime Video on Google devices, such as Android TVs,  you couldn't get Google-based content on Fire TV devices.

Where the Fire TV Cube excels, as you might imagine, is with voice commands. With this box, you'll never need to worry about where the remote is hiding this time. It's inside your couch, by the way; it's always hidden between the couch cushions, in my vast experience of losing remotes. 

It also, thanks to Alexa, will let you, after setting it up properly, let you switch HDMI inputs and even change cable channels. 

There's only one real problem with the new model Fire TV Cube, and it's one it shared with the rest of the Fire family: Amazon is not shy about putting its Prime video offerings front and center in its interface. And there's no way to change that. As it happens, I watch a lot of shows on Prime, but even for me, it's gotten a bit old. 

Amazon also offers a wide array of other streaming devices in its Fire family. At  $50, the Amazon Fire TV Stick an affordable, high-quality streaming gadget. 

I haven't been happy with the last few Apple TV generations, but Apple finally got its groove back with the 2019 edition of the Apple TV 4K. For example, it finally supports 4K streaming, HDR, and applications for most of the major streaming services. But I really hoped there'd be a 2020 Apple TV. Alas, there wasn't.

Of course, the Apple TV 4K is heavily Apple-centric. That's great if you have your own iTunes or Apple TV app-based media library. On the other hand, it can't stream a full 4K HDR video from such external services as Netflix, YouTube, or Vudu. It will play them, yes, but it downscales them to 1080p HDTV.

At $179 for the 32GB version or $199 for the 64GB version of the Apple TV 4K, like all Apple products, it's not cheap. You can save some money by simply getting the $179 version. Unlike earlier models, the Apple TV only uses its onboard storage for applications and games. It streams all its videos. So, if all you'll ever do with it is steam videos, there's no reason to buy the pricier model. The Apple TV 4K's bottom line is it's great for anyone whose life is built around Apple products or the $4.99 Apple+ streaming service. Others can spend far less to watch the same shows."

Apple has dominated the tablet conversation for years with its iPad line, but it's not the only company with a tablet that's worthy of making our top tablets of 2020 list.     

Also: The best iPad: Which iPad model should you buy?

Below is a list of TK tablets, in random order, that are designed to fit specific needs and budgets. Whether you're looking for a cheap device for your kids or something that can effectively replace a computer, there's a tablet for everyone. 

Samsung's Galaxy Tab Active Pro is designed to be used and abused. Its IP68 rating and MIL-STD 810G shock/drop resistant rating mean it will survive in a harsh environment, while still giving you access to its Android interface. It even comes with a ruggedized version of Samsung's S Pen stylus, allowing you to sketch on construction plans, or take notes out in the field without fear of dropping a delicate tablet. 

Apple updated the base model iPad in early September, adding a faster processor. The display still measures 10.2 inches and support for Apple's Smart Keyboard Cover is still present. With the optional keyboard, you can use the 8th generation iPad to work through your inbox or write a research paper on a device that's compact and portable. The latest iPad also supports the Apple Pencil for those who want something to jot notes or sketch on. 

Amazon's Fire tablets run the company's forked version of Android, complete with Amazon's services baked right in. The Fire HRD 10 is affordable, faster than ever, and doubles as an Echo, with Alexa awaiting your commands. I've been testing one for the past few weeks and have been impressed. The Fire HD 10 is perfect for someone who wants to browse the internet, watch videos, or check email without spending a ton of money. 

Samsung's Tab S7 and S7 Plus run Android, integrates with Samsung's products and services, and includes an S-Pen in the box. Samsung has an optional keyboard accessory for those who want to get some work done, which auto triggers the company's DeX platform that converts either tablet into a more laptop-like Android experience. Both models have the option to expand storage, those who want to be entertained on the go can store up to an additional 512GB of movies and music. 

The S7 starts at $650, while the S7 Plus starts at $850. 

The Surface Go 2 was a welcomed update to Microsoft's smallest and most portable 2-in-1 for Windows fans. It uses the same design as the original Go, and will even work with all of the original accessories, including the Type Cover keyboard. 

The Go 2 faster internals that provides a better overall experience and performance, but you'll still want to skip the entry-level model. The combination of slower storage and a slower processor isn't going to be an enjoyable experience.  

The tablet runs Windows 10 in S Mode and limits you to installing apps from only the Microsoft Store, along with a few other security features. But you can opt for the full Windows 10 experience be leaving S Mode and never looking back. 

Apple just announced the 2020 iPad Pro, and on the outside, it looks nearly identical to the 2018 model. There's a new camera array on the iPad Pro line that features a LiDAR sensor to improve augmented reality. On the inside, there's a new, faster processor that speeds up performance across the board. For someone who wants to push the limits of what an iPad can do, the 2020 iPad Pro is the only choice. With a unique design, USB-C for charging and connecting external storage (as well as up to a 4K monitor), the iPad Pro is as good as it gets when it comes to a tablet. There's an 11-inch model along with a 12.9-inch model for those who want more space to get more work done. 

The Surface Pro X is the like aforementioned Surface Go, only bigger and more powerful. It runs full Windows 10 out of the box but is limited to 32-bit apps. That means unless you rely on CAD software, and some select third-party apps, you won't have any issues using the Pro X. It has built-in LTE connectivity, a 13-inch display, and is just 7.3mm thin. There's even a special compartment in the optional keyboard to hide the Surface Pen -- it's pretty cool

The iPad Air was updated in September, bringing a completely new design and iPad Pro-like features to the mid-range tablet. It has a 10.9-inch display, USB-C port, along with Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil support. It's also priced between the two tablets, with the specifications to match. The Air is perfect for someone who wants to push the limits of what the base iPad can do, but feels the iPad Pro is overkill. 

Amazon's Fire HD 8 and HD 8 Plus have a new design, a faster processor, and have retained their budget-friendly prices. The HD 8 is the most affordable at $90, but for $110, you go from 2GB of memory to 3GB, and gain wireless charging. There's even an optional wireless charging stand you can buy that charges the HD 8 Plus while simultaneously turning it into what amounts to be an Echo Show. 

You'll have access to Amazon's Appstore of apps, all of Android's apps and services like Prime Video, Kindle, and Music. It's a heck of a lot of tablet for very little money. 

The Surface Pro 7 is a full-fledged 2-in-1 that's powered by an Intel processor and runs Windows 10 just like any other PC. It includes USB-C and USB-A ports to connect any type of accessory to it and has a battery life of around 10.5 hours. For someone who wants a full-fledge PC in a tablet form factor, it's hard to beat the Surface Pro 7. 

The iPad Mini is the smallest version of the iPad that Apple offers, and for a few update cycles, it felt like it had been forgotten. Earlier this year Apple updated the Mini, adding Apple Pencil support and upgrading its internals. The Mini doesn't work with Apple's keyboard cover, but to be honest, that'd feel pretty cramped. But with Pencil support, it does make for a good note or sketchpad.

Samsung took the Galaxy Tab S6, removed a few features and lowered the price, and the end result is the Tab S6 Lite. It's not the fastest or most capable tablet you can buy, but it's still a respectable tablet -- especially when you factor in that it includes Samsung's S Pen stylus. "
29,https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-new-m1-macbook-air-vs-the-ipad-pro/,Compare: Apple's M1 MacBook Air kills the iPad Pro for the rest of us,"The M1-powered MacBook Air sports all the power of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro and Magic Keyboard, for hundreds of dollars less. If you aren't using the iPad's camera or the Apple Pencil, is there any reason to get the big iPad?",Robin Harris,2020-11-25 13:01:00,Storage Bits,"Now that Apple offers Apple Silicon in the MacBook Air, the vast gulf between iPad and Mac performance and battery life has almost disappeared. I've been happily using a 12.9-inch iPad Pro for more than a year. I've been even happier using the Magic Keyboard, the pricy but excellent add-on keyboard.  

But the new MacBook Air has me doubting my life choices. Would I be better served by a MacBook Air? Comparing the two, here's what I found. 

For the same price as a Wi-Fi 1TB iPad Pro and Magic Keyboard - $1,849 - you can get a MacBook Air with a 2TB SSD and 8GB of DRAM. Or save $400 and get the 1TB MacBook Air. That's a substantial difference. 

The difference is more substantial at the entry-level MacBook Air at $999. The equivalent 256GB 12.9-inch   iPad Pro costs $1,099 + $349 for the Magic Keyboard. That's a 45% increment for the additional iPad Pro features. 

The heaviest load I've put on my iPad Pro is editing multiple streams of 4k video, which it handled flawlessly. I can't imagine overloading the even more powerful M1, even with the lowest spec 7 GPU units and 8GB of DRAM. Both CPUs are more than I need, so that's a wash. 

My iPad Pro + Magic Keyboard weighs in at 1373 grams, versus the MacBook Air's 1290 grams. Lighter wins for me. 

While I've never had a problem with the iPad Pro's 10-hour battery life, the M1 MacBook Air's 15-hour battery life is even better. 

The iPad Pro sports a 12.9-inch Retina Multi‑Touch display, at 2732-by-2048-pixel resolution at 264 pixels per inch (ppi), with very smooth ProMotion variable refresh feature. The 1.8% reflectivity and 600 nits brightness mean it can be used almost anywhere except direct sunlight, which in Arizona is pretty much a daytime constant. 

The MacBook Air Retina display is larger at 13.3 inches but with lower 2560-by-1600 native resolution at 227 ppi. It is also dimmer, at 400 nits brightness. But with the better battery life I could keep the brightness cranked up and probably be OK. 

I'm fine with the size of the 12.9-inch iPad display, and the other features - along with touch - make it a clear winner over the MacBook Air display. 

The iPad Magic Keyboard lifts up the iPad about an inch closer to eye level. It's a small difference, but it adds up over hours of use. OTOH, the MacBook Air trackpad is much larger. 

No contest here: the MacBook Air, with two Thunderbolt 4 ports, is way ahead of the iPad Pro's single USB-C port. That said, I rarely use the USB-C port for anything other than charging, even though I have a couple of hubs just in case.

Thunderbolt makes the MacBook Air a feasible desktop replacement with a Thunderbolt dock for add-on storage and accessories. However, you can equip the iPad Pro with cellular connectivity, which may be a win for you.  

The MacBook Air is a clear winner here, with support for an external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz, and VGA, HDMI, DVI, and Thunderbolt 2 output support using adapters. The iPad Pro is limited to mirroring the built-in display, except for a few apps like iMovie. 

The iPad Pro's front-facing camera offers HDR, Portrait mode, and 4K video recording. It kills for video calling, FaceTime, and Zoom. 

The MacBook Air webcam is 720p and object of many complaints, but I've found them acceptable  in good light. The M1 MacBook Air's webcam is enhanced by the chip's video processor, but the iPad Pro clearly beats it. 

Which is better, the iPad Pro or the MacBook Air? It depends on what you use it for. 

The iPad Pro is an integrated video and art production studio in a portable package. But I'm primarily a writer and only using it with a keyboard wastes many of its excellent and costly features. 

I don't need the video features as I'd rather shoot with my iPhone and the add-on lenses I have. I'm no artist, so the Apple Pencil is a non-starter. I rarely use the webcam, as I prefer the 5k iMac screen. 

Apple is going to have to work hard to justify the iPad Pro line now that its performance is available in a less costly system. iOS is easier to manage, but as Pro apps are optimized for Apple Silicon, the combination of a high-end iPhone with an M1 MacBook Air or MacBook Pro will mean that unless you use an Apple Pencil, the iPad Pro won't be the Pro choice. Lesser iPads, with their lower entry cost, will still make sense for common use cases. 

As a result of this analysis I've put my iPad Pro + Magic Keyboard up for sale. Looking forward to seeing whether the M1 MacBook Air works for me. 

Comments welcome. Can anyone think of a reason I should keep my iPad Pro? 

The entry-level MacBook Air starts at $999.

The equivalent 256GB 12.9-inch iPad Pro costs $1,099.

Apple's Magic Keyboard adds $349. "
